# DeskLab Memory Bank for Claude

Last updated: 2026-07-16, Asia/Shanghai

## Mission

DeskLab is a connected 3D room desktop layout and cabling tool. The long-term product direction is:

- The user models their current room, furniture, devices, power strips, outlets, and cable connections.
- AI later analyzes the model and proposes options:
  - free layout/cabling improvements,
  - paid purchase recommendations,
  - step-by-step changes after purchase.
- The product does not cover in-wall electrical work or construction.
- Generic realistic device categories are enough. Do not spend excessive time chasing exact branded SKU models.

The current work mode is autonomous engineering:

- Pick one high-value, reproducible vertical slice at a time.
- Prefer test-first when fixing bugs or hardening behavior.
- Make the smallest change that moves the product toward robustness.
- Run the full relevant verification.
- Commit only the files changed for that slice.
- Do not ask the user technical questions unless there is a true product decision or irreversible action.

## Repositories

Frontend:
```
D:\desklab\frontend
```

Backend:
```
D:\desklab\backend
```

GitHub repositories (public):
```text
Frontend: https://github.com/hollowell1225/desklab-frontend
Backend:  https://github.com/hollowell1225/desklab-backend
```

Canonical tracked memory-bank copy:
```text
D:\desklab\frontend\docs\memory_bank.md
```

Keep this external handoff copy and the tracked copy synchronized whenever the
memory bank is updated. The tracked copy is committed and pushed with the
frontend repository so it is protected by the GitHub backup.

Expected dev URLs:
```
Frontend: http://localhost:5173/
Backend:  http://localhost:3001/api/projects/default
```

Services may or may not be running. Check and restart them when needed.

Additional handoff docs:
```
D:\desklab\memory-bank\DeskLab-model-assets-plan.md
D:\desklab\memory-bank\DeskLab-AI-handoff-template.md
```

Frontend commands:
```bash
npm test
npm run lint
npm run build
npm run dev
```

Backend commands:
```bash
npm test
npm run check:contracts
npm start
```

## Critical Safety Rules

- Frontend was moved to `D:\desklab\frontend` and rebaselined as a new git repository during the D-drive migration. The old frontend `.git` history could not be recovered after Windows partially moved hidden git files. Current frontend git history starts at `eef96fe`.

- Backend untracked is local editor state. DO NOT touch:
  ```
  ?? .vscode/
  ```

- Do NOT overwrite or delete: `D:\desklab\backend\data\default-project.json`
  Backend tests that touch runtime data should back it up and restore it, or use isolated test storage.

- Never claim browser/visual QA unless actually performed. If browser runtime fails, record the failure instead of pretending.

```
Power-load reads are fully centralized: an audit of `src/` for raw
`maxLoad ??` / `wattage ??` reads or inlined `> maxLoad * 0.9` thresholds is clean.

Code-native generic model assets now exist for:
- `monitor-24`, `monitor-27`, `ultrawide-monitor`
- `power-strip`
- `router`
- `switch`
- `ups`
- `desktop-pc`
- `mini-pc`
- `power-adapter`
- `wall-outlet`
- `laptop-15`
- `nas-2bay`
- `modem`
- `all-in-one`
- `office-desk`
- `gaming-desk`
- `standing-desk`
- `l-desk`

The generic model-asset backlog for catalog models with `assetUrl: null` is now
covered. All generic furniture, monitors, computers, power adapters, wall
Every catalog generic model is now constrained through the shared normalized
layout module and a catalog-driven regression test prevents future coverage
gaps. The next safe target is a small hardening opportunity found from current
code evidence.

### Runtime QA performed (2026-06-25, real, not faked)
- Booted both servers: backend `node server.js` (3001) + frontend `vite` (5173),
  both HTTP 200. Backend was already running once during the session (a duplicate
  start hit `EADDRINUSE` — harmless).
- Loaded the app via the Claude_Preview MCP. DOM mounts (`title=DeskLab`), and the
  UI header showed `布局检查 (2)`, `布线检查 (5)`, `改进建议 (6)` against the real
  `default-project.json` (7 objects, 2 connections) — i.e. the analysis +
  recommendation engine works end-to-end on real data.
- LIMITATION: `preview_screenshot` times out — the react-three-fiber WebGL canvas
  stays at default 300x150 in the headless preview (no GPU). DOM/console QA works;
  pixel screenshots of the 3D scene do not. Use a real browser for visual model QA.
- Console QA surfaced and fixed a real React 19 warning (`inert=""`); after the fix
  a fresh preview load reports zero console errors.
- Preview launch config lives at `D:\.claude\.claude\launch.json` (name
  `desklab-frontend`, runs `npm --prefix D:\desklab\frontend run dev`, port 5173,
  `autoPort:false`). It is outside both repos, so the "no untracked files"
  invariant for the frontend repo still holds.

### Generic monitor model asset slice (2026-06-26)
- Added a code-native, in-house, generic low-poly monitor render path for
  `monitor-24`, `monitor-27`, and `ultrawide-monitor`; no external meshes,
  scraped assets, logos, or branded silhouettes were introduced.
- `src/domain/model-assets.js` owns the lightweight generic asset registry.
  `SceneObjects.jsx` keeps GLB `assetUrl` rendering first, uses the generic
  monitor only when no external asset URL is present, and preserves the box
  fallback for unknown models.
- Added `test/model-assets.test.js` to lock the monitor asset mapping and
  unknown-model fallback behavior.
- Updated `public/models/ATTRIBUTION.md` with DeskLab-owned source notes for
  the code-native monitor.
- Verification: `node --test test\model-assets.test.js`, `npm test` (176
  passed), `npm run lint`, `npm run build`.
- Browser/visual QA: Browser plugin bootstrap failed in this Codex environment
  because the Node browser runtime reported missing sandbox metadata, so QA
  used local Chrome headless via DevTools Protocol against
  `http://127.0.0.1:5173/` with the local backend on `http://localhost:3001`.
  Desktop 1440x900 and mobile 390x844 loaded with no error overlay and no
  console errors; adding "24 英寸显示器" from the asset library selected
  `monitor-24` and showed the monitor in the canvas. Console warnings were
  limited to the existing `THREE.Clock` deprecation from Three/Drei.

### Generic power-strip model asset slice (2026-06-26)
- Added a code-native, in-house, generic low-poly power strip render path for
  `power-strip`; no external meshes, scraped assets, logos, or branded
  silhouettes were introduced.
- `src/domain/model-assets.js` now maps `power-strip` to
  `generic-power-strip`. `SceneObjects.jsx` renders a long body, top socket
  plate, six generic socket pairs, and an input end block while preserving GLB
  `assetUrl` priority and unknown-model box fallback.
- Expanded `test/model-assets.test.js` to lock the power-strip asset mapping.
- Updated `public/models/ATTRIBUTION.md` with DeskLab-owned source notes for
  the code-native power strip.
- Verification: `node --test test\model-assets.test.js`, `npm test` (177
  passed), `npm run lint`, `npm run build`.
- Browser/visual QA: Browser plugin bootstrap still failed because the Node
  browser runtime reported missing sandbox metadata, so QA used local Chrome
  headless via DevTools Protocol against `http://127.0.0.1:5173/` with the
  local backend on `http://localhost:3001`. Desktop 1440x900 and mobile 390x844
  loaded with no error overlay and no console errors; adding "插排" from the
  "电源" asset category selected `power-strip` and showed the model in the
  canvas. Console warnings were limited to the existing `THREE.Clock`
  deprecation from Three/Drei.

### Generic router model asset slice (2026-06-26)
- Added a code-native, in-house, generic low-poly router render path for
  `router`; no external meshes, scraped assets, logos, or branded silhouettes
  were introduced.
- `src/domain/model-assets.js` now maps `router` to `generic-router`.
  `SceneObjects.jsx` renders a compact router body, front network ports,
  two simple antennas, and a status light while preserving GLB `assetUrl`
  priority and unknown-model box fallback.
- Expanded `test/model-assets.test.js` to lock the router asset mapping.
- Updated `public/models/ATTRIBUTION.md` with DeskLab-owned source notes for
  the code-native router.
- Verification: `node --test test\model-assets.test.js`, `npm test` (178
  passed), `npm run lint`, `npm run build`.
- Browser/visual QA: after the same Browser plugin bootstrap failure already
  observed this session, QA used local Chrome headless via DevTools Protocol
  against `http://127.0.0.1:5173/` with the local backend on
  `http://localhost:3001`. Desktop 1440x900 and mobile 390x844 loaded with no
  error overlay and no console errors; adding "路由器" from the "网络" asset
  category selected `router` and showed the model in the canvas. Console
  warnings were limited to the existing `THREE.Clock` deprecation from
  Three/Drei.

### Generic switch model asset slice (2026-06-26)
- Added a code-native, in-house, generic low-poly network switch render path for
  `switch`; no external meshes, scraped assets, logos, or branded silhouettes
  were introduced.
- `src/domain/model-assets.js` now maps `switch` to `generic-switch`.
  `SceneObjects.jsx` renders a long switch body, dark front panel, eight
  generic Ethernet ports, and small status LEDs while preserving GLB `assetUrl`
  priority and unknown-model box fallback.
- Expanded `test/model-assets.test.js` to lock the switch asset mapping.
- Updated `public/models/ATTRIBUTION.md` with DeskLab-owned source notes for
  the code-native switch.
- Verification: `node --test test\model-assets.test.js`, `npm test` (179
  passed), `npm run lint`, `npm run build`.
- Browser/visual QA: using local Chrome headless via DevTools Protocol against
  `http://127.0.0.1:5173/` with the local backend on `http://localhost:3001`,
  desktop 1440x900 and mobile 390x844 loaded with no error overlay and no
  console errors; adding "交换机" from the "网络" asset category selected
  `switch` and showed the model in the canvas. Console warnings were limited
  to the existing `THREE.Clock` deprecation from Three/Drei.

### Generic UPS model asset slice (2026-06-26)
- Added a code-native, in-house, generic low-poly UPS render path for `ups`;
  no external meshes, scraped assets, logos, or branded silhouettes were
  introduced.
- `src/domain/model-assets.js` now maps `ups` to `generic-ups`.
  `SceneObjects.jsx` renders a vertical UPS body, front panel, display area,
  power button, status light, and vent slots while preserving GLB `assetUrl`
  priority and unknown-model box fallback.
- Expanded `test/model-assets.test.js` to lock the UPS asset mapping.
- Updated `public/models/ATTRIBUTION.md` with DeskLab-owned source notes for
  the code-native UPS.
- Verification: `node --test test\model-assets.test.js`, `npm test` (180
  passed), `npm run lint`, `npm run build`.
- Browser/visual QA: Browser plugin bootstrap still failed because the Node
  browser runtime reported missing sandbox metadata, so QA used local Chrome
  headless via DevTools Protocol against `http://127.0.0.1:5173/` with the
  local backend on `http://localhost:3001`. Desktop 1440x900 and mobile 390x844
  loaded with no error overlay and no console errors; adding "UPS" from the
  "电源" asset category selected `ups` and showed the model in the canvas.
  Console warnings were limited to the existing `THREE.Clock` deprecation from
  Three/Drei.

- Added a code-native, in-house, generic low-poly tower PC render path for
  `desktop-pc`; no external meshes, scraped assets, logos, or branded
  silhouettes were introduced.
- `src/domain/model-assets.js` now maps `desktop-pc` to
  `generic-desktop-pc`. `SceneObjects.jsx` renders a tower body, inset front
  panel, fan vent, power button/status light, and two front ports while
  preserving GLB `assetUrl` priority and unknown-model box fallback.
- Expanded `test/model-assets.test.js` test-first to lock the desktop PC asset
  mapping. The focused test failed on the previous `null` mapping before the
  implementation and passed afterward.
- Updated `public/models/ATTRIBUTION.md` with DeskLab-owned source notes for
  the code-native desktop PC.
- Verification: `node --test test\model-assets.test.js` (7 passed), `npm test`
  (181 passed), `npm run lint`, `npm run build`. The existing large-chunk build
  warning remains non-fatal.
- Browser/visual QA: not completed. Both localhost services returned HTTP 200,
  but the Browser plugin bootstrap failed because the runtime request lacked
  required sandbox metadata (`sandboxPolicy`). No browser or visual QA is
  claimed.
- Commit: `4f4bd89 feat: add generic desktop pc model asset` (pushed to
  `origin/master`).

### Generic mini PC model asset slice (2026-07-05)

  (182 passed), `npm run lint`, `npm run build`. The existing large-chunk build
  warning remains non-fatal.
- Browser/visual QA: not completed. Both localhost services returned HTTP 200,
  but Browser bootstrap again failed because the runtime request lacked
  required sandbox metadata (`sandboxPolicy`). No browser or visual QA is
  claimed.
- Commit: `55b9ddb feat: add generic mini pc model asset` (pushed to
  `origin/master`).

### Generic power adapter model asset slice (2026-07-05)

  `origin/master`).

### Generic wall outlet model asset slice (2026-07-05)
- Added a code-native, in-house, generic low-poly dual wall outlet render path
  for `wall-outlet`; no external meshes, scraped assets, logos, or branded
  silhouettes were introduced.
- `src/domain/model-assets.js` now maps `wall-outlet` to
  `generic-wall-outlet`. `SceneObjects.jsx` renders a thin wall plate, inset
  faceplate, two outlet rows, and a center fastener while preserving existing
  wall-snap rotation, GLB `assetUrl` priority, and unknown-model box fallback.
- Expanded `test/model-assets.test.js` test-first to lock the outlet mapping.

### Generic gaming desk model asset slice (2026-07-05)
- Added a code-native, in-house, generic low-poly gaming desk render path for
  `gaming-desk`; no external meshes, logos, or branded silhouettes.
- `src/domain/model-assets.js` maps `gaming-desk` to `generic-gaming-desk`.
  `SceneObjects.jsx` renders a wide desktop, angled legs, rear crossbar, and
  monitor shelf, all kept within the catalog bounding box while preserving GLB
  priority and box fallback.
- Expanded `test/model-assets.test.js` test-first; the focused test failed on
  the previous `null` mapping before implementation and passed afterward.
- Updated `public/models/ATTRIBUTION.md` with DeskLab-owned source notes.
- Verification: focused tests 16/16; `npm test` 190/190; lint and build passed.
  The existing large-chunk warning remains non-fatal.
- Browser/visual QA: not completed because Browser bootstrap remained blocked
  by missing `sandboxPolicy` metadata. No browser or visual QA is claimed.
- Commit: `3a2e4d2 feat: add generic gaming desk model asset` (pushed).


### Generic standing desk model asset slice (2026-07-13)
- Added a code-native, in-house, generic low-poly adjustable standing desk
  render path for `standing-desk`; no external meshes, logos, or branded
  silhouettes were introduced.
- `src/domain/model-assets.js` maps `standing-desk` to
  `generic-standing-desk`. `SceneObjects.jsx` renders a desktop, two lift
  columns, lower sleeves, feet, rear crossbar, and front control panel while
  preserving GLB priority and box fallback.
- Expanded `test/model-assets.test.js` test-first; the focused test failed on
  the previous `null` mapping before implementation and passed afterward.
- Updated `public/models/ATTRIBUTION.md` with DeskLab-owned source notes.
- Verification: focused `node --test test\model-assets.test.js` passed 17/17;
  `npm test` passed 191/191; `npm run lint` passed; `npm run build` passed
  after rerun with permission to write Vite's `node_modules\.vite-temp`, with
  the existing non-fatal large chunk warning.
- Runtime endpoint QA: `curl.exe -sS -I http://127.0.0.1:5173/` returned HTTP
  200, and `curl.exe -sS http://localhost:3001/api/projects/default` returned
  the default project JSON. No backend write/save was performed.
- Browser/visual QA: not completed in this handoff slice because the user
  explicitly disallowed Codex IAB, page screenshots, and Base64 image output;
  no browser or visual QA is claimed for this slice.
- Commit: `18ce68a feat: add generic standing desk model asset` (pushed).

### Generic L desk model asset slice (2026-07-13)
- Added a code-native, in-house, generic low-poly L-shaped desk render path for
  `l-desk`; no external meshes, logos, or branded silhouettes were introduced.
- `src/domain/model-assets.js` maps `l-desk` to `generic-l-desk`.
  `SceneObjects.jsx` renders intersecting desktop slabs, four legs, and rear
  cable trays while preserving GLB priority and box fallback.
- Expanded `test/model-assets.test.js` test-first; the focused test failed on
  the previous `null` mapping before implementation and passed afterward.
- Updated `public/models/ATTRIBUTION.md` with DeskLab-owned source notes.
- Verification: focused `node --test test\model-assets.test.js` passed 18/18;
  `npm test` passed 192/192; `npm run lint` passed; `npm run build` passed
  with the existing non-fatal large chunk warning.
- Runtime endpoint QA: `curl.exe -sS -I http://127.0.0.1:5173/` returned
  HTTP 200, and `curl.exe -sS http://localhost:3001/api/projects/default`
  returned the default project JSON. No backend write/save was performed.
- Browser/visual QA: not completed because the user explicitly disallowed
  Codex IAB, page screenshots, and Base64 image output; no browser or visual
  QA is claimed for this slice.
- Commit: `13d483d feat: add generic l-desk model asset` (pushed).

### Generic catalog asset coverage regression test (2026-07-13)
- Added a public-interface regression test in `test/model-assets.test.js` that
  enumerates every `DEVICE_CATALOG` model with `assetUrl: null` and requires a
  matching in-house generic asset with the same category and DeskLab-owned
  metadata.
- This prevents future catalog additions from silently falling back to an
  unstyled box while leaving external GLB-backed models unaffected.
- Verification: `node --test test\model-assets.test.js` passed 19/19;
  `npm test` passed 193/193; `npm run lint` passed; `npm run build` passed
  with the existing non-fatal large chunk warning.
- Browser/visual QA: not performed because the user explicitly disallowed
  Codex IAB, page screenshots, and Base64 image output.
- Commit: `f64d4e7 test: cover generic assets for catalog models` (pushed).

### Generic L desk geometry-bound regression fix (2026-07-13)
- Fixed a real L-desk rendering defect: the right desktop slab extended to
  normalized depth `0.54`, beyond the catalog footprint limit of `0.5`.
- Added `src/domain/generic-model-layouts.js` as the shared layout seam for the
  L-desk desktop slabs, legs, and cable trays. `SceneObjects.jsx` now renders
  from this layout instead of duplicating placement constants.
- Added `test/generic-model-layouts.test.js`; its public-interface assertion
  failed against the previous right-top position and passed after the slab was
  moved inside the footprint.
- Verification: focused geometry/model-asset tests passed 20/20; `npm test`
  passed 194/194; `npm run lint` passed; `npm run build` passed with the
  existing non-fatal large chunk warning.
- Runtime endpoint QA: frontend and local backend `curl` checks both returned
  HTTP 200. No backend write/save was performed.
- Browser/visual QA: not performed because the user explicitly disallowed
  Codex IAB, page screenshots, and Base64 image output.
- Commit: `60ca14c fix: keep generic l-desk within catalog bounds` (pushed).

### Generic standing desk geometry-bound regression test (2026-07-13)
- Added normalized shared layout data for the standing desk's top, lift columns,
  sleeves, feet, rear crossbar, and control panel in
  `src/domain/generic-model-layouts.js`.
- `SceneObjects.jsx` now renders those horizontal placements and dimensions from
  the shared layout, rather than maintaining a second set of geometry constants.
- Added a test-first public-interface assertion that the standing desk remains
  inside its catalog footprint. It failed before the standing-desk layout was
  registered and passed once the renderer consumed it.
- Verification: focused layout tests passed 2/2; `npm test` passed 195/195;
  `npm run lint` and `npm run build` passed with the existing non-fatal large
  chunk warning.
- Runtime endpoint QA: frontend and local backend `curl` checks returned HTTP
  200. No backend write/save was performed.
- Browser/visual QA: not performed because the user explicitly disallowed
  Codex IAB, page screenshots, and Base64 image output.
- Commit: `961ae2d test: cover generic standing desk layout bounds` (pushed).

### Generic office desk geometry-bound regression test (2026-07-13)
- Added normalized shared layout data for the office desk's desktop, four legs,
  and rear cable tray in `src/domain/generic-model-layouts.js`.
- `SceneObjects.jsx` now renders the office desk's horizontal placement and
  footprint dimensions from that shared layout, avoiding duplicate constants.
- Added a test-first public-interface assertion that the office desk remains
  inside its catalog footprint. It failed before the office-desk layout was
  registered and passed once the renderer consumed it.
- Verification: focused layout tests passed 3/3; `npm test` passed 196/196;
  `npm run lint` and `npm run build` passed with the existing non-fatal large
  chunk warning.
- Runtime endpoint QA: frontend and local backend `curl` checks returned HTTP
  200. No backend write/save was performed.
- Browser/visual QA: not performed because the user explicitly disallowed
  Codex IAB, page screenshots, and Base64 image output.
- Commit: `f2f10f4 test: cover generic office desk layout bounds` (pushed).

### Generic gaming desk geometry-bound regression test (2026-07-13)
- Added normalized shared layout data for the gaming desk's desktop, two angled
  legs, rear crossbar, and monitor shelf in `src/domain/generic-model-layouts.js`.
- `SceneObjects.jsx` now renders the gaming desk's horizontal placement,
  footprint dimensions, and leg rotation from the shared layout rather than
  duplicating constants.
- Added a test-first public-interface assertion that the gaming desk remains
  inside its catalog footprint. It failed before the gaming-desk layout was
  registered and passed once the renderer consumed it.
- Verification: focused layout tests passed 4/4; `npm test` passed 197/197;
  `npm run lint` and `npm run build` passed with the existing non-fatal large
  chunk warning.
- Runtime endpoint QA: frontend and local backend `curl` checks returned HTTP
  200. No backend write/save was performed.
- Browser/visual QA: not performed because the user explicitly disallowed
  Codex IAB, page screenshots, and Base64 image output.
- Commit: `92d0eb7 test: cover generic gaming desk layout bounds` (pushed).

### Generic monitor geometry-bound regression test (2026-07-13)
- Added one normalized shared layout for the monitor panel, screen, rear housing,
  stand, and base, mapped to `monitor-24`, `monitor-27`, and
  `ultrawide-monitor` in `src/domain/generic-model-layouts.js`.
- `GenericMonitorModel` now reads that layout through the object's real
  `modelId`, keeping the three catalog variants on the same render/test seam.
- Added a test-first public-interface assertion for all three monitor model ids.
  It failed before their shared layout was registered and passed once rendering
  consumed it.
- Verification: focused layout tests passed 5/5; `npm test` passed 198/198;
  `npm run lint` and `npm run build` passed with the existing non-fatal large
  chunk warning.
- Runtime endpoint QA: frontend and local backend `curl` checks returned HTTP
  200. No backend write/save was performed.
- Browser/visual QA: not performed because the user explicitly disallowed
  Codex IAB, page screenshots, and Base64 image output.
- Commit: `525b695 test: cover generic monitor layout bounds` (pushed).

### Generic desktop PC geometry-bound regression fix (2026-07-13)
- Added one normalized shared layout for the tower body, front panel, fan vent,
  power button, status light, and two front ports, mapped to `desktop-pc` in
  `src/domain/generic-model-layouts.js`.
- Added a test-first public-interface assertion for `desktop-pc`. It failed
  before the layout was registered and passed after rendering consumed it.
- Fixed a real catalog-footprint overflow: front details previously extended
  through normalized depth `0.51–0.60`; they now remain at or inside the front
  boundary (`z <= 0.5`). The status light uses independent X/Z scale so that
  its layout descriptor remains correct after non-uniform object resizing.
- Verification: focused layout tests passed 6/6; `npm test` passed 199/199;
  `npm run lint` and `npm run build` passed with the existing non-fatal large
  chunk warning.
- Runtime endpoint QA: frontend and local backend `curl` checks returned HTTP
  200. No backend write/save was performed.
- Browser/visual QA: not performed because the user explicitly disallowed
  Codex IAB, page screenshots, and Base64 image output.
- Commits: `2731fd0 fix: keep generic desktop pc within catalog bounds` and
  `fd1fa11 fix: preserve desktop pc scale behavior` (pushed).

### Generic mini PC geometry-bound regression fix (2026-07-13)
- Added one normalized shared layout for the compact body, top vent, power
  button, status light, and two front ports, mapped to `mini-pc` in
  `src/domain/generic-model-layouts.js`.
- Added a test-first public-interface assertion for `mini-pc`. It failed before
  the layout was registered and passed after rendering consumed it.
- Fixed a real catalog-footprint overflow: the front button, status light, and
  ports previously extended through normalized depth `0.51–0.55`; their visible
  geometry now remains inside the front boundary (`z <= 0.5`). Independent X/Z
  scale preserves the default silhouette and keeps the layout valid after
  non-uniform object resizing.
- Verification: focused layout tests passed 7/7; `npm test` passed 200/200;
  `npm run lint` and `npm run build` passed with the existing non-fatal large
  chunk warning.
- Runtime endpoint QA: frontend and local backend `curl` checks returned HTTP
  200. No backend write/save was performed.
- Browser/visual QA: not performed because the user explicitly disallowed
  Codex IAB, page screenshots, and Base64 image output.
- Commit: `c15e614 fix: keep generic mini pc within catalog bounds` (pushed).

### Generic power adapter geometry-bound regression fix (2026-07-13)
- Added one normalized shared layout for the adapter body, top label, two AC
  pins, and DC strain relief, mapped to `power-adapter` in
  `src/domain/generic-model-layouts.js`.
- Added a test-first public-interface assertion for `power-adapter`. It failed
  before the layout was registered and passed after rendering consumed it.
- Fixed real catalog-footprint overflows: AC pins previously extended to
  normalized depth `0.86` and the DC strain relief to `-0.73`; both now remain
  inside the `[-0.5, 0.5]` footprint. The strain-relief cylinder uses independent
  X/Z scale to preserve the default silhouette after non-uniform resizing.
- Verification: focused layout tests passed 8/8; `npm test` passed 201/201;
  `npm run lint` and `npm run build` passed with the existing non-fatal large
  chunk warning.
- Runtime endpoint QA: frontend and local backend `curl` checks returned HTTP
  200. No backend write/save was performed.
- Browser/visual QA: not performed because the user explicitly disallowed
  Codex IAB, page screenshots, and Base64 image output.
- Commit: `6706f06 fix: keep generic power adapter within catalog bounds`
  (pushed).

### Generic wall outlet geometry-bound regression fix (2026-07-13)
- Added one normalized shared layout for the outlet body, faceplate, four slots,
  and center fastener, mapped to `wall-outlet` in
  `src/domain/generic-model-layouts.js`.
- Added a test-first public-interface assertion for `wall-outlet`. It failed
  before the layout was registered and passed after rendering consumed it.
- Fixed real catalog-footprint overflows: the faceplate, slots, and fastener
  previously extended through normalized depth `0.56`, `0.60`, and `0.62`;
  all now remain inside the front boundary (`z <= 0.5`).
- Verification: focused layout tests passed 9/9; `npm test` passed 202/202;
  `npm run lint` and `npm run build` passed with the existing non-fatal large
  chunk warning. Local frontend and backend `curl` checks returned HTTP 200.
- Browser/visual QA: not performed because the user explicitly disallowed
  Codex IAB, page screenshots, and Base64 image output.
- Commit: `f6c4b16 fix: keep generic wall outlet within catalog bounds`
  (pushed).

### Generic NAS geometry-bound regression fix (2026-07-13)
- Added one normalized shared layout for the NAS body, front panel, two drive
  bays, drive handles, and status lights, mapped to `nas-2bay` in
  `src/domain/generic-model-layouts.js`.
- Added a public layout-bound assertion for `nas-2bay` and made rendering consume
  the same layout data.
- Fixed the front components' real normalized-depth overflow (up to `0.615`):
  panel, bays, handles, and lights now remain within `z <= 0.5`.
- Verification: focused layout tests 10/10; `npm test` 203/203; `npm run lint`
  and `npm run build` passed with the existing non-fatal large chunk warning;
  local frontend and backend `curl` checks returned HTTP 200.
- Browser/visual QA: not performed because the user explicitly disallowed
  Codex IAB, page screenshots, and Base64 image output.
- Commit: `a6ad8cd fix: keep generic nas within catalog bounds` (pushed).

### Generic modem geometry-bound regression fix (2026-07-13)
- Added a normalized shared layout for the modem body, top plate, status lights,
  and front ports, mapped to `modem`; front ports now remain at `z <= 0.5`.
- Test-first `modem` bounds assertion failed before registration and passed after.
- Verification: focused tests 11/11; `npm test` 204/204; lint, build, and local
  frontend/backend HTTP checks passed. Browser/visual QA was not performed.
- Commit: `b74e570 fix: keep generic modem within catalog bounds` (pushed).

### Generic router geometry-bound regression fix (2026-07-13)
- Added a normalized shared layout for the router body, four ports, antennas,
  and status light. The port centers moved from `z=0.51` to `z=0.46` so their
  visible geometry remains within the catalog footprint.
- Test-first `router` bounds assertion failed before layout registration and
  passed afterward. Verification: focused 12/12; `npm test` 205/205; lint,
  build, and local frontend/backend HTTP checks passed. Browser QA not performed.
- Commit: `4770cb1 fix: keep generic router within catalog bounds` (pushed).

### Generic switch geometry-bound regression fix (2026-07-14)
- Added one normalized shared layout for the switch body, front panel, eight
  ports, and status lights. The panel and ports moved to `z=0.46`, keeping
  their visible geometry within the catalog footprint.
- Test-first `switch` bounds assertion failed before layout registration and
  passed afterward. Verification: focused 13/13; `npm test` 206/206; lint,
  build, and local frontend/backend HTTP checks passed. Browser QA not performed.
- Commit: `257d1df fix: keep generic switch within catalog bounds` (pushed).

### Generic UPS geometry-bound regression fix (2026-07-14)
- Added normalized shared layout data for the UPS body, front panel, display,
  button, status light, and five vents. All front components now stay inside
  the catalog footprint.
- Test-first `ups` assertion failed before layout registration and passed after.
  Verification: focused 14/14; `npm test` 207/207; lint, build, and local
  frontend/backend HTTP checks passed. Browser QA not performed.
- Commit: `7adc0db fix: keep generic ups within catalog bounds` (pushed).

### Generic power strip geometry-bound regression fix (2026-07-14)
- Added normalized layout data for the strip body, top plate, six socket pairs,
  and input end. The input end moved from `x=-0.47,z=-0.52` to `x=-0.45,z=-0.42`,
  keeping its full visible geometry inside the footprint.
- Test-first `power-strip` assertion failed before registration and passed after.
  Verification: focused 15/15; `npm test` 208/208; lint, build, and local
  frontend/backend HTTP checks passed. Browser QA not performed.
- Commit: `67d30cf fix: keep generic power strip within catalog bounds` (pushed).

### Generic all-in-one layout coverage (2026-07-14)
- Added one shared normalized layout for the panel, screen, lower bezel, rear
  housing, stand, and base, mapped to `all-in-one`. Existing geometry remained
  within bounds; this slice makes that invariant executable and removes duplicate
  render constants.
- Test-first `all-in-one` bounds assertion failed before layout registration and
  passed after. Verification: focused 16/16; `npm test` 209/209; lint, build,
  and local frontend/backend HTTP checks passed. Browser QA not performed.
- Commit: `0ac9589 test: cover generic all-in-one layout bounds` (pushed).

### Generic laptop layout coverage (2026-07-14)
- Added one shared normalized layout for the laptop base, keyboard, lid, screen,
  and hinge, mapped to `laptop-15`; the existing in-bounds geometry is unchanged.
- Test-first `laptop-15` assertion failed before registration and passed after.
  Verification: focused 17/17; `npm test` 210/210; lint, build, and local
  frontend/backend HTTP checks passed. Browser QA not performed.
- Commit: `d8b3682 test: cover generic laptop layout bounds` (pushed).

### Generic catalog layout coverage guard (2026-07-14)
- Added one catalog-driven regression test requiring every `assetUrl: null`
  catalog model to have an in-bounds shared layout. This protects future catalog
  additions against silently bypassing geometry-bound coverage.
- Verification: focused 18/18; `npm test` 211/211; lint, build, and local
  frontend/backend HTTP checks passed. Browser QA not performed.
- Commit: `59597c1 test: require bounds layouts for generic catalog models`
  (pushed).

### Clipboard import size guard (2026-07-14)
- Added `project-import-limits.js` with the shared 5MB byte limit and UTF-8 text
  byte measurement. File and clipboard imports now use the same guard before
  JSON parsing or validation.
- This fixes the prior clipboard-only gap, where arbitrarily large text could be
  parsed before the backend's request-size protection applied.
- Verification: focused 2/2; `npm test` 213/213; lint, build, and local
  frontend/backend HTTP checks passed. Browser QA not performed.
- Commit: `b2db1ed fix: limit clipboard project imports` (pushed).

### Zero project-history limit guard (2026-07-14)
- Fixed a history-limit boundary bug: JavaScript `slice(-0)` retained every
  snapshot, so `limit: 0` unintentionally created unbounded undo history.
  Limits are now safely normalized and zero explicitly disables snapshots.
- Test-first regression coverage verifies zero history has neither undo nor redo.
- Verification: focused 6/6; `npm test` 214/214; lint, build, and local
  frontend/backend HTTP checks passed. Browser QA not performed.
- Commit: `26be343 fix: respect zero project history limit` (pushed).

### Project-history clock-rollback group guard (2026-07-14)
- Fixed a grouping boundary bug: a negative elapsed time from a system-clock
  rollback still satisfied the prior `< groupWindowMs` check, merging an
  independent operation into the previous undo group.
- Grouping now requires a non-decreasing timestamp as well as being within the
  configured time window. Test-first coverage confirms undo returns the second
  operation after a clock rollback.
- Verification: focused 7/7; `npm test` 215/215; lint, build, and local
  frontend/backend HTTP checks passed. Browser QA not performed.
- Commit: `cfd9581 fix: prevent clock rollback history grouping` (pushed).

### Optional power-metadata validation guard (2026-07-14)
- Closed a frontend/backend contract gap: the backend rejected invalid optional
  `wattage` and `maxLoad`, but shared frontend envelope validation accepted
  them, allowing bad data to survive load/import/draft recovery until save.
- The shared validator now accepts those fields only when absent, null, or a
  non-negative finite number. Regression coverage rejects string and negative
  values for both fields in a successful-looking project response.
- Verification: project-client 33/33; draft 18/18; `npm test` 216/216; lint,
  build, and local frontend/backend HTTP checks passed. Browser QA not performed.
- Commit: `51f12ba fix: validate optional power metadata` (pushed).

### Backend null port-anchor normalization guard (2026-07-14)
- Fixed a backend 500 path: `anchor: null` was explicitly accepted as an
  optional port value, but output normalization unconditionally read its
  coordinates and threw a `TypeError`.
- Normalization now preserves an explicit null anchor and still copies valid
  coordinate objects, keeping the output stable for ETag versioning.
- Verification: backend validate 22/22; `npm test` 31/31;
  `npm run check:contracts` passed. No browser or visual QA performed.
- Commit: backend `fd2eb33 fix: preserve null port anchors` (pushed).

### Nullable port-anchor contract alignment (2026-07-14)
- Aligned the JSON Schema and OpenAPI 3.1 Port schemas with the runtime and
  frontend behavior: optional `anchor` now explicitly accepts either a
  normalized vector or `null`.
- Updated the read-only contract checker to require both alternatives while
  retaining the normalized-vector range checks. The checker was red before
  the update and green afterward.
- Verification: `npm run check:contracts`; backend `npm test` 31/31. No
  browser or visual QA performed.
- Commit: backend `ddf4c1e contract: allow null port anchors` (pushed).

### OpenAPI power-metadata contract guard (2026-07-14)
- Added missing `wattage` and `maxLoad` fields (non-negative numbers) to the
  OpenAPI Object schema, matching the persisted JSON Schema and runtime
  validation.
- The read-only contract checker now requires both fields; it failed before
  the OpenAPI update and passed afterward.
- Verification: `npm run check:contracts`; backend `npm test` 31/31. No
  browser or visual QA performed.
- Commit: backend `2aa0943 contract: document power metadata in openapi`
  (pushed).

### Null optional model-metadata normalization guard (2026-07-14)
- Fixed a response-contract mismatch: compatibility validation accepted
  `category`, `modelId`, and `color` as null, then wrote those nulls back even
  though the formal schemas declare them optional strings.
- Normalization now omits null values for those metadata fields while retaining
  meaningful `assetUrl: null` values used by in-house generic models.
- Verification: backend validate 23/23; `npm test` 32/32;
  `npm run check:contracts` passed. No browser or visual QA performed.
- Commit: backend `9ecbcc9 fix: normalize null model metadata` (pushed).

### Auto-network direction guard (2026-07-14)
- Fixed invalid auto-network recommendations for custom/imported ethernet ports:
  the previous matching logic checked only type and occupancy, so an
  output-only device port could be suggested as a connection target.
- The suggestion now requires the device port to receive and the distributor
  port to provide network traffic, with the existing port-semantics guard on
  both ends. Regression coverage fails against the prior suggestion and passes
  after the change.
- Verification: recommendations 36/36; `npm test` 217/217; lint, build, and
  local frontend/backend HTTP checks passed. Browser QA not performed.
- Commit: `bb3d27b fix: validate auto-network port directions` (pushed).

### Switch purchase direction guard (2026-07-14)
- Fixed an invalid `buy_switch` purchase suggestion for custom/imported
  ethernet ports. The capacity calculation previously counted an output-only
  device uplink as an unconnected client port, which could recommend a switch
  even when no device could receive a LAN connection.
- Device ports now count only when they can receive network traffic; router LAN
  ports count only when they can provide it. Both paths reuse the existing
  port-semantics consistency guard.
- Regression coverage was added test-first: it fails against the prior logic
  for an output-only ethernet device and passes after the guard.
- Verification: recommendations 37/37; `npm test` 218/218; lint, build, and
  local frontend/backend HTTP checks passed. Browser QA not performed.
- Commit: `a90dab6 fix: filter invalid switch recommendations` (pushed).

### Case-insensitive LAN port recognition (2026-07-14)
- Fixed a false `buy_switch` purchase recommendation for custom/imported router
  ports such as `LAN-1`. LAN capacity recognition previously matched only a
  lower-case `lan` substring in the port id, treating that valid port as absent.
- Router LAN port ids now compare case-insensitively while retaining the
  existing ethernet type, output direction, and semantics checks.
- Regression coverage was added test-first and confirms a single custom
  `LAN-1` router port supplies capacity for one ethernet device.
- Verification: recommendations 38/38; `npm test` 219/219; lint, build, and
  local frontend/backend HTTP checks passed. Browser QA not performed.
- Commit: `f69fec0 fix: match LAN port ids case-insensitively` (pushed).

### Null recommendation-state guard (2026-07-14)
- Fixed a recommendation-panel crash when a transient project state supplied
  `null` for the project itself, `objects`, or `connections`. Default
  destructuring handles only `undefined`, so `null` previously reached wiring
  analysis and failed on an array operation.
- The facade now normalizes those two collections to empty arrays and safely
  destructures a nullable project, returning a stable empty recommendation set.
- Regression coverage confirms the facade remains safe for both forms of null
  live state.
- Verification: recommendations 38/38; `npm test` 219/219; lint, build, and
  local frontend/backend HTTP checks passed. Browser QA not performed.
- Commit: `cf36b14 fix: tolerate null recommendation state` (pushed).

### Invalid power-input recommendation guard (2026-07-14)
- Fixed a recommendation path that could generate an invalid connection for a
  custom AC/DC input port whose direction contradicted its power type. Wiring
  analysis correctly reported the malformed port, but the recommendation engine
  still offered automatic power connection or a power purchase; the generated
  auto-connection would then be rejected by backend validation.
- Auto-power and buy-power paths now skip semantically inconsistent target
  inputs, leaving the configuration error for the user to correct rather than
  proposing an impossible fix.
- Test-first coverage verifies that an `ac_input` marked as `output` receives
  neither a free auto-power nor a paid power recommendation.
- Verification: recommendations 39/39; `npm test` 220/220; lint, build, and
  local frontend/backend HTTP checks passed. Browser QA not performed.
- Commit: `96ab864 fix: skip invalid power input recommendations` (pushed).

### Invalid power-strip capacity guard (2026-07-14)
- Fixed a false `buy_power_strip` recommendation for a malformed AC output.
  The previous capacity calculation treated an `ac_output` with an input
  direction as a usable outlet when an invalid connection occupied it.
- Only directionally consistent AC outputs now contribute to power-strip
  capacity, so a configuration error does not look like a full valid strip.
- Test-first coverage uses an invalid occupied output and confirms no purchase
  suggestion is produced.
- Verification: recommendations 40/40; `npm test` 221/221; lint, build, and
  local frontend/backend HTTP checks passed. Browser QA not performed.
- Commit: `1465637 fix: ignore invalid strip output capacity` (pushed).

### Invalid power-graph edge guard (2026-07-14)
- Fixed false load, overload, and UPS-purchase analysis caused by the shared
  power graph accepting any AC/DC output-to-input link. It previously skipped
  the direction, port-compatibility, and cable-type checks already enforced by
  wiring analysis.
- The shared graph now includes only semantically valid power connections, so
  malformed directions, AC/DC type mismatches, and wrong cable types cannot
  inflate upstream electrical load.
- Test-first coverage verifies all three invalid-link classes contribute zero
  load while valid recursive load calculations remain unchanged.
- Verification: analysis 19/19; `npm test` 222/222; lint, build, and local
  frontend/backend HTTP checks passed. Browser QA not performed.
- Commit: `4831314 fix: exclude invalid links from power graph` (pushed).

### Duplicate power-port graph guard (2026-07-14)
- Fixed a remaining disagreement between the shared power graph and wiring
  analysis: two individually valid links could reuse one physical power port.
  Wiring analysis rejects the later link, but the graph previously counted both
  loads and could create a false overload/UPS purchase recommendation.
- The graph now mirrors the nested per-object port-occupancy rule and ignores
  later conflicting connections in their deterministic input order.
- Test-first coverage confirms a duplicate source outlet counts only the first
  300W load rather than both connected loads.
- Verification: analysis 20/20; `npm test` 223/223; lint, build, and local
  frontend/backend HTTP checks passed. Browser QA not performed.
- Commit: `2ff0bfc fix: dedupe occupied power graph ports` (pushed).

### Self-referencing wiring guard (2026-07-14)

- Problem: the backend contract rejects a connection whose two endpoints belong
  to the same object, but frontend wiring analysis treated one as valid. For a
  power connection this derived a misleading `power_cycle` issue and occupied
  ports instead of marking the corrupt connection for removal.
- Test-first regression: `test/analysis.test.js` now supplies one object with
  AC input/output ports joined by a self-reference; it must emit
  `self_connection`, must not emit `power_cycle`, and must expose the connection
  through `getInvalidConnectionIds`.
- Fix: `analyzeProjectWiring` now rejects same-object endpoints after confirming
  both referenced objects exist, emitting an error with `invalidConnectionIds`
  and skipping all subsequent semantic, occupancy, and power-graph work.
- Verification: focused test first red then green; `npm test` 224/224;
  `npm run lint`; `npm run build` (known non-fatal large-chunk warning only);
  local frontend `/` and backend `/api/projects/default` HTTP checks both 200.
  No browser or visual QA was performed.
- Commit: `42177ce fix: flag self-referencing connections` (pushed).

### Invalid recommendation-occupancy guard (2026-07-14)

- Problem: wiring analysis correctly excludes invalid links from port occupancy,
  but both recommendation builders independently counted every raw connection.
  A self-referencing invalid power link could therefore consume a usable source
  port, suppress `auto_power_device`, and create a false purchase suggestion.
- Test-first regression: `test/recommendations.test.js` creates an invalid
  self-link on a strip's AC output and a nearby unpowered device. The available
  output must still produce an auto-power fix and must prevent a paid-power
  recommendation.
- Fix: both free and purchase recommendation occupancy maps now derive a shared
  invalid-id set from `wiringIssues` and skip those connections. This preserves
  deterministic valid-link occupancy while matching analysis semantics.
- Verification: focused test first red then green; `npm test` 225/225;
  `npm run lint`; `npm run build` (known non-fatal large-chunk warning only);
  local frontend `/` and backend `/api/projects/default` HTTP checks both 200.
  No browser or visual QA was performed.
- Commit: `a85b16a fix: ignore invalid connection occupancy` (pushed).

### Blank connection-port guard (2026-07-14)

- Problem: `analyzeProjectWiring` used truthiness to detect endpoint ports, so
  explicit empty-string IDs were mislabeled as a legacy unbound connection.
  The frontend envelope and backend validator both reject those IDs.
- Test-first regression: an HDMI link with both port IDs set to `''` must emit
  `missing_connection_port`, not `legacy_connection`, and must be returned as
  invalid for cleanup/recommendation filtering.
- Fix: port-binding detection now matches validation semantics: a port field is
  present whenever it is neither `undefined` nor `null`; its non-blank validity
  is then checked through the ordinary endpoint lookup path.
- Verification: focused test first red then green; `npm test` 226/226;
  `npm run lint`; `npm run build` (known non-fatal large-chunk warning only);
  local frontend `/` and backend `/api/projects/default` HTTP checks both 200.
  No browser or visual QA was performed.
- Commit: `a163378 fix: reject blank connection port ids` (pushed).

### Duplicate connection-ID guard (2026-07-14)

- Problem: persisted projects reject duplicate connection IDs, but direct wiring
  analysis accepted distinct links that reused one ID when their ports differed.
- Test-first regression: two valid HDMI links with the same ID and different
  endpoint ports must report `duplicate_connection_id` and expose that ID as
  invalid.
- Fix: wiring analysis tracks connection IDs in input order and skips each
  later duplicate before it can affect occupancy or derived power analysis.
- Verification: focused test first red then green; `npm test` 227/227; lint,
  build (known non-fatal large-chunk warning), and local frontend/backend HTTP
  checks passed. No browser or visual QA was performed.
- Commit: `373067b fix: flag duplicate connection ids` (pushed).

### Display-recommendation UI action (2026-07-14)

- Problem: the recommendation engine created valid `auto_connect_display`
  patches (HDMI, DisplayPort, and USB-C) and the modal listed them, but the UI
  offered no action button. Users could not apply a displayed recommendation.
- Fix: `App.jsx` now renders a “连接显示器” button for that code and applies the
  existing tested patch through history, connection state, and a success notice,
  matching the power/network action paths.
- Verification: the existing recommendation tests cover generated and applied
  HDMI/USB-C display links; `npm test` 227/227; lint; build (known non-fatal
  large-chunk warning); local frontend/backend HTTP checks passed. No browser or
  visual QA was performed.
- Commit: `3d39356 fix: apply display connection recommendations` (pushed).

### Unpowered purchase-recommendation UI action (2026-07-14)

- Problem: `buy_power_for_unpowered` had no modal action despite carrying an
  explicit product choice (`power-strip` for AC or `ups` for DC).
- Fix: the recommendation now offers the matching existing add-item action and
  closes the modal, consistent with other purchase recommendations.
- Verification: `npm test` 227/227; lint; build (known non-fatal large-chunk
  warning); local frontend/backend HTTP checks passed. No browser or visual QA.
- Commit: `0e50733 fix: apply unpowered purchase recommendations` (pushed).

### Invalid-connection cleanup count (2026-07-14)

- Fixed cleanup confirmation/button/status counts to use the actual number of
  connection objects removed, rather than unique invalid IDs. This correctly
  reports two removals when a duplicate-ID conflict requires both records to go.
- Verification: `npm test` 227/227; lint; build (known non-fatal large-chunk
  warning); local frontend/backend HTTP checks passed. No browser or visual QA.
- Commit: `ae4d983 fix: count invalid connections accurately` (pushed).

### Duplicate power-graph connection-ID guard (2026-07-14)

- Fixed a remaining split between wiring analysis and the shared power graph:
  later connections that reused a connection ID could still inflate load totals.
- The graph now skips later duplicate IDs in deterministic input order, matching
  analysis and preventing false overload/UPS recommendations.
- Verification: test-first 600W→300W regression; `npm test` 228/228; lint;
  build (known non-fatal large-chunk warning); local frontend/backend HTTP
  checks passed. No browser or visual QA was performed.
- Commit: `d7656ab fix: dedupe power graph connection ids` (pushed).

### Post-purchase wiring guidance (2026-07-14)

- Problem: purchasing a recommended UPS, power strip, or switch only added the
  object and closed the recommendation modal. The new hardware was selected but
  the user received neither a safe connection order nor a direct route to the
  wiring tools.
- Test-first regression: `test/purchase-guidance.test.js` requires each of the
  three purchasable hardware models to expose a concrete, safe next step and
  requires unknown hardware to return no invented plan. The focused test first
  failed because the guidance module did not exist.
- Fix: `src/domain/purchase-guidance.js` owns the UPS, power-strip, and switch
  guidance. `App.jsx` preserves the recommendation modal after a hardware
  purchase, keeps the new device selected, displays the model-specific order,
  and offers “打开连接面板”. The action opens the selected device's connection
  tab; it deliberately creates no automatic links because the real source,
  uplink, and loads are user-specific physical decisions.
- Verification: focused test first red then green; `npm test` 230/230;
  `npm run lint`; `npm run build` (known non-fatal large-chunk warning only);
  local frontend `/` and backend `/api/projects/default` HTTP checks both 200.
  No browser or visual QA was performed.
- Commit: `7841a36 feat: guide wiring after hardware purchase` (pushed).

### Router-uplink network recommendation guard (2026-07-14)

- Problem: automatic network recommendations could attach a device to the
  nearest switch even when that switch had no valid Ethernet path to a router.
  A dual-port ordinary device could also accidentally make a switch appear
  reachable. Both cases create a cable that looks connected without providing
  actual network access.
- Test-first regressions verify that a disconnected switch and a switch reached
  only through a regular dual-port device are rejected, while a switch directly
  uplinked to a router remains eligible for downstream auto-connections.
- Fix: `recommendations.js` now builds router-originated Ethernet reachability
  from valid connections only. Reachability can propagate only through routers
  and switches; automatic network fixes may use a router or a reachable switch.
- Verification: focused recommendations tests 44/44; `npm test` 233/233;
  `npm run lint`; `npm run build` (known non-fatal large-chunk warning only);
  local frontend `/` and backend `/api/projects/default` HTTP checks both 200.
  No browser or visual QA was performed.
- Commit: `77aa29f fix: require router uplink for network suggestions` (pushed).

### Switch purchase guidance power step (2026-07-14)

- Fixed the switch post-purchase sequence so it now requires power first,
  router LAN uplink second, and downstream devices last. The previous wording
  omitted the switch's AC input and could leave an apparently wired but
  inoperative network segment.
- Test-first coverage updated the public guidance contract; it failed against
  the old sequence and passes with the corrected order.
- Verification: `npm test` 233/233; `npm run lint`; `npm run build` (known
  non-fatal large-chunk warning only); local frontend `/` and backend
  `/api/projects/default` HTTP checks both 200. No browser or visual QA was
  performed.
- Commit: `436bb69 fix: include switch power step in guidance` (pushed).

### Full-router switch migration guidance (2026-07-14)

- Problem: a switch purchase is still necessary when the router has zero free
  LAN ports, but the ordinary uplink instruction was impossible to follow.
- Fix: `buy_switch` now marks that LAN migration is required when no router LAN
  port is free. The post-purchase flow passes that fact to the guidance module,
  which instructs the user to power the switch, move one existing router client
  to it, use the freed LAN port for the uplink, then connect remaining devices.
- Test-first coverage verifies the recommendation context and the specialized
  public guidance contract.
- Verification: `npm test` 235/235; `npm run lint`; `npm run build` (known
  non-fatal large-chunk warning only); local frontend `/` and backend
  `/api/projects/default` HTTP checks both 200. No browser or visual QA was
  performed.
- Commit: `bbf0291 feat: guide switch purchases when router is full` (pushed).

### Full-router switch guidance clarification (2026-07-14)

- Fixed an unsafe implication in the full-router switch guide: an occupied LAN
  port may be an uplink rather than a movable endpoint. The sequence now asks
  the user to free a LAN port suitable for the new uplink and presents moving a
  normal endpoint to the switch as one optional way to do so.
- Test-first coverage updated the guidance contract; `npm test` 235/235, lint,
  build (known non-fatal large-chunk warning), and local frontend/backend HTTP
  checks all passed. No browser or visual QA was performed.
- Commit: `f08c985 fix: clarify full-router switch guidance` (pushed).

### Switch uplink action (2026-07-14)

- Added a free `auto_uplink_switch` recommendation and modal action that safely
  joins an unconnected switch to a free router LAN port. It is offered only when
  no ordinary endpoint is waiting for that same capacity, so “apply all” cannot
  create competing uses of a router port.
- Test-first coverage verifies the generated router-to-switch patch; full
  verification: `npm test` 236/236, lint, build (known non-fatal large-chunk
  warning), and local frontend/backend HTTP 200. No browser or visual QA.
- Commit: `1bde233 feat: suggest switch uplinks` (pushed).

### Reachable switch capacity guard (2026-07-14)

- Fixed `buy_switch` capacity planning so an arbitrary switch object no longer
  suppresses a purchase recommendation. Only free Ethernet output or
  bidirectional ports on switches with a valid router-originated path count as
  available downstream capacity.
- Regression coverage uses a portless, disconnected switch alongside more
  unconnected endpoints than the router can serve; the purchase recommendation
  must remain present.
- Verification: focused recommendations 48/48; `npm test` 238/238; `npm run
  lint`; `npm run build` (known non-fatal large-chunk warning only); local
  frontend `/` and backend `/api/projects/default` HTTP checks both 200. No
  browser or visual QA was performed.
- Commit: `97bfffe fix: count reachable switch capacity` (pushed).

### Multi-router capacity guard (2026-07-14)

- Fixed `buy_switch` planning to sum valid, unoccupied LAN capacity across all
  routers instead of considering only the first router in the object list.
  This avoids a false purchase recommendation when a later router can serve
  the remaining Ethernet endpoint.
- Test-first regression: the new test failed against the first-router-only
  logic and passes after the aggregate-capacity change.
- Verification: focused recommendations 49/49; `npm test` 239/239; `npm run
  lint`; `npm run build` (known non-fatal large-chunk warning only); local
  frontend `/` and backend `/api/projects/default` HTTP checks both 200. No
  browser or visual QA was performed.
- Commit: `7530afe fix: count capacity across routers` (pushed).

### WAN port capacity guard (2026-07-14)

- Fixed a mismatch between purchase planning and automatic network wiring:
  switch ports marked as `WAN` are intentionally not used as downstream
  network sources, so they no longer count as available switch capacity when
  deciding whether a switch purchase is needed.
- Test-first regression covers a router-uplinked switch whose only remaining
  Ethernet port is `WAN`; the prior calculation incorrectly suppressed the
  needed purchase recommendation.
- Verification: focused recommendations 50/50; `npm test` 240/240; `npm run
  lint`; `npm run build` (known non-fatal large-chunk warning only); local
  frontend `/` and backend `/api/projects/default` HTTP checks both 200. No
  browser or visual QA was performed.
- Commit: `bf82644 fix: exclude WAN ports from switch capacity` (pushed).

### WAN switch uplink guard (2026-07-14)

- Fixed the remaining WAN-port inconsistency: `auto_uplink_switch` could wire
  a router LAN port to a switch `WAN` port even though downstream automatic
  networking deliberately rejects that port. Such an action looked successful
  but could not deliver the capacity it promised.
- A shared WAN-port predicate now protects switch-uplink selection, automatic
  network source selection, and switch-capacity planning. Test-first coverage
  verifies that a switch whose only candidate port is `WAN` receives no uplink
  recommendation.
- Verification: focused recommendations 51/51; `npm test` 241/241; `npm run
  lint`; `npm run build` (known non-fatal large-chunk warning only); local
  frontend `/` and backend `/api/projects/default` HTTP checks both 200. No
  browser or visual QA was performed.
- Commit: `a41e62c fix: reject WAN switch uplinks` (pushed).

### Powered-switch uplink guard (2026-07-14)

- Fixed automatic switch uplinks that could be offered before a switch's valid
  AC/DC power input was connected. The previous text promised downstream
  network access even though an unpowered switch cannot forward traffic.
- `auto_uplink_switch` now waits only when a switch explicitly declares power
  inputs and all of them are unconnected through valid links. Devices with no
  modeled power input retain the existing behavior.
- Test-first regression verifies that an unpowered switch gets no uplink
  suggestion; the available power recommendation is therefore the required
  next step before the UI recomputes the uplink.
- Verification: focused recommendations 52/52; `npm test` 242/242; `npm run
  lint`; `npm run build` (known non-fatal large-chunk warning only); local
  frontend `/` and backend `/api/projects/default` HTTP checks both 200. No
  browser or visual QA was performed.
- Commit: `9659963 fix: require switch power before uplink` (pushed).

### Dependency-aware one-click free fixes (2026-07-14)

- Fixed the recommendation modal's “apply all free improvements” action so it
  no longer stops after the first static suggestion list. A prerequisite such
  as powering a switch can reveal a safe switch-uplink action only after it is
  applied.
- Added `applyAllAvailableImprovements(project)`: it recomputes free
  improvements after each pass and applies only suggestion IDs not already
  applied, which guarantees termination while allowing newly unlocked fixes to
  run in the same user action. The existing `applyAllImprovements` retains its
  original static-list semantics.
- Test-first regression proves a single action powers a switch and then adds
  its router uplink. The modal now uses this dependency-aware operation and
  reports that all available free improvements were applied.
- Verification: focused recommendations 53/53; `npm test` 243/243; `npm run
  lint`; `npm run build` (known non-fatal large-chunk warning only); local
  frontend `/` and backend `/api/projects/default` HTTP checks both 200. No
  browser or visual QA was performed.
- Commit: `72a9f2e feat: apply newly unlocked free improvements` (pushed).

### Powered network-capacity guard (2026-07-14)

- Fixed a topology bug where reachability traversal added every adjacent device
  to the router-reachable set before deciding whether that device could forward
  traffic. An Ethernet-uplinked but unpowered switch could consequently be
  used as an automatic network source and counted as capacity; an unpowered
  router could be used as a source as well.
- Router roots, forwarding switches, free router LAN capacity, and automatic
  uplink candidates now require a valid connected AC/DC input when one is
  modeled. Traversal records only operational routers and switches, so the same
  invariant drives auto-networking and switch-purchase capacity.
- Test-first regressions verify that an unpowered router is not a network
  source and an unpowered uplinked switch cannot suppress a needed switch
  recommendation.
- Verification: focused recommendations 55/55; `npm test` 245/245; `npm run
  lint`; `npm run build` (known non-fatal large-chunk warning only); local
  frontend `/` and backend `/api/projects/default` HTTP checks both 200. No
  browser or visual QA was performed.
- Commit: `9d81dbc fix: require power for network capacity` (pushed).

### Dynamic free-fix patch guard (2026-07-14)

- Fixed a second-pass correctness issue in `applyAllAvailableImprovements`.
  It previously deduplicated solely by suggestion ID. If an earlier layout fix
  changed the required cable length, the later `extend-cable:<id>` suggestion
  retained its ID and the updated patch was incorrectly skipped.
- Deduplication now keys on both suggestion ID and serialized patch content:
  identical work still terminates, while a genuinely updated corrective patch
  can run in a later pass.
- Test-first regression reproduces an off-wall outlet snap that increases an
  already-short power cable from a 0.79m to a 2.79m requirement; one-click
  free fixes now reapplies the cable adjustment and leaves no cable warning.
- Verification: focused recommendations 56/56; `npm test` 246/246; `npm run
  lint`; `npm run build` (known non-fatal large-chunk warning only); local
  frontend `/` and backend `/api/projects/default` HTTP checks both 200. No
  browser or visual QA was performed.
- Commit: `89097cd fix: reapply changed free improvements` (pushed).

### Powered-source supply guard (2026-07-14)

- Fixed automatic power recommendations and purchase suppression that treated an
  unplugged power strip, UPS, or adapter as a usable source merely because it
  exposed a free output port. This could wire a device to a dead upstream and
  then hide the power recommendation it still needed.
- Both `auto_power_device` and the `buy_power_for_unpowered` availability check
  now exclude any candidate that models AC/DC inputs but has none connected by
  a valid link. Wall outlets and other modeled root sources with no input stay
  eligible.
- Test-first regression verifies an unpowered strip neither powers a PC nor
  suppresses the PC's purchase recommendation. Existing positive tests now use
  explicit wall-outlet→strip/adapter supply links, preserving coverage for
  automatic AC/DC cabling, invalid occupancy, and free-port purchase handling.
- Verification: focused recommendations 57/57; `npm test` 247/247; `npm run
  lint`; `npm run build` (known non-fatal large-chunk warning only); local
  frontend `/` and backend `/api/projects/default` HTTP checks both 200. No
  browser or visual QA was performed.
- Commit: `797fbdc fix: require powered auto power sources` (pushed).

### Rooted power-path guard (2026-07-14)

- Hardened the powered-source check from direct input occupancy to a real path
  through `buildPowerGraph()`: sources are usable only when reachable from a
  modeled root source with no AC/DC input, over valid compatible power
  connections.
- An unpowered upstream strip or adapter can no longer make a downstream strip,
  router, or switch appear operational. The same powered set now gates automatic
  power cabling, purchase suppression, router LAN capacity, switch capacity,
  automatic switch uplinks, and automatic network connections.
- Test-first regressions cover a strip fed only by an unpowered upstream strip
  and a router fed by an unpowered adapter; both are excluded until a root power
  path exists. `buildRecommendations()` also shares its already-built power graph
  with free improvements.
- Verification: focused recommendations 58/58; `npm test` 248/248; `npm run
  lint`; `npm run build` (known non-fatal large-chunk warning only); local
  frontend `/` and backend `/api/projects/default` HTTP checks both 200. No
  browser or visual QA was performed.
- Commit: `206adcd fix: require rooted power paths` (pushed).

### Independent power-load guard (2026-07-14)

- Fixed an unrelated power-cycle fault suppressing all power-load calculations.
  Previously `computeDevicePowerLoad()` returned zero whenever the global power
  graph contained any cycle, hiding overloads on separate valid branches.
- Load traversal now cuts only a back edge on its active recursion path. Valid
  independent branches continue to contribute their known load, while cyclic
  paths still terminate safely without recursion.
- Test-first regression creates a separate two-device cycle beside a 300W hub
  branch and verifies the hub still reports 300W.
- Verification: focused analysis 25/25; `npm test` 249/249; `npm run lint`;
  `npm run build` (known non-fatal large-chunk warning only); local frontend `/`
  and backend `/api/projects/default` HTTP checks both 200. No browser or visual
  QA was performed.
- Commit: `33eff79 fix: preserve independent power loads` (pushed).

### Malformed power-root guard (2026-07-14)

- Hardened root-source detection: any device that declares an AC/DC input is
  now treated as needing an actual valid root-to-device path, even if that input
  has an invalid direction in malformed imported/live data.
- This prevents a broken power strip or adapter with an output port from being
  silently promoted to an independent supply source, which previously could
  auto-wire a PC to dead hardware and suppress its power purchase guidance.
- Test-first regression covers an AC-input port incorrectly declared as output;
  it cannot power a PC and cannot suppress the PC's purchase recommendation.
- Verification: focused recommendations 59/59; `npm test` 250/250; `npm run
  lint`; `npm run build` (known non-fatal large-chunk warning only); local
  frontend `/` and backend `/api/projects/default` HTTP checks both 200. No
  browser or visual QA was performed.
- Commit: `51353a9 fix: reject malformed power roots` (pushed).

### Automatic-connection idempotency guard (2026-07-14)

- Fixed `applyImprovement()` appending the same automatic connection patch more
  than once. A rapid double click or stale callback could previously create a
  duplicate connection ID, leaving a locally invalid project that the backend
  correctly rejects on save.
- The new-connection patch path now returns the existing project unchanged when
  its connection ID already exists, making automatic power, network, display,
  and switch-uplink applications safe to retry.
- Test-first regression applies a deterministic automatic power connection twice
  and verifies the second application is a no-op.
- Verification: focused recommendations 60/60; `npm test` 251/251; `npm run
  lint`; `npm run build` (known non-fatal large-chunk warning only); local
  frontend `/` and backend `/api/projects/default` HTTP checks both 200. No
  browser or visual QA was performed.
- Commit: `97d60c3 fix: make automatic connections idempotent` (pushed).

### Stale connection-port conflict guard (2026-07-14)

- Hardened automatic connection application beyond duplicate IDs: a stale
  recommendation is now also rejected when either of its physical endpoint
  ports has already been claimed by a newer connection with a different ID.
- This keeps a delayed/rapid UI action from creating duplicate port occupancy,
  matching the backend's connection contract before the project reaches save.
- Test-first regression reserves the outlet port through a newer connection,
  then verifies a stale automatic power patch is a no-op.
- Verification: focused recommendations 61/61; `npm test` 252/252; `npm run
  lint`; `npm run build` (known non-fatal large-chunk warning only); local
  frontend `/` and backend `/api/projects/default` HTTP checks both 200. No
  browser or visual QA was performed.
- Commit: `cc991f7 fix: reject stale connection port conflicts` (pushed).

### Deleted connection-endpoint guard (2026-07-14)

- Completed the stale automatic-connection safety boundary: before appending a
  generated connection, `applyImprovement()` now verifies that both referenced
  devices still exist in the current project.
- A delayed callback can no longer reintroduce a deleted device as a dangling
  connection reference and leave the local project unsavable by the backend.
  Duplicate IDs and occupied endpoint ports remain protected by the adjacent
  guards.
- Test-first regression removes the target device before applying its old power
  suggestion and verifies the operation is a no-op. Existing retry and occupied
  port tests now use present endpoints to retain their intended coverage.
- Verification: focused recommendations 62/62; `npm test` 253/253; `npm run
  lint`; `npm run build` (known non-fatal large-chunk warning only); local
  frontend `/` and backend `/api/projects/default` HTTP checks both 200. No new
  browser or visual QA was performed for this domain-only change.
- Commit: `8f6ca7c fix: reject deleted connection endpoints` (pushed).

### Stale connection-port validity guard (2026-07-14)

- Extended automatic-connection application to verify current port-level
  semantics before appending: both ports must still exist, have valid source/
  target directions and compatible types, and still imply the patch's cable
  type.
- A stale suggestion now becomes a no-op if a user deletes or reconfigures an
  endpoint port, instead of introducing a connection the backend would reject.
  This completes the stale-patch boundary across device existence, port
  existence/semantics, port occupancy, and duplicate connection IDs.
- Test-first regression removes the source power port while retaining both
  devices; the old power suggestion is rejected. Existing stale-ID and occupied
  port regressions now define valid endpoint ports to preserve their scope.
- Verification: focused recommendations 63/63; `npm test` 254/254; `npm run
  lint`; `npm run build` (known non-fatal large-chunk warning only); local
  frontend `/` and backend `/api/projects/default` HTTP checks both 200. No new
  browser or visual QA was performed for this domain-only change.
- Commit: `f26c112 fix: validate stale connection ports` (pushed).

### Missing improvement-target guard (2026-07-14)

- Completed the stale-patch no-op boundary for layout and cable patches. When a
  suggestion targets an object or connection that was deleted before the action
  runs, `applyImprovement()` now returns the exact existing project instead of
  allocating an unchanged project state.
- This keeps the domain operation as a strict no-op that callers can recognize;
  existing valid layout and cable applications still create immutable updates.
- Test-first regression covers both a deleted object layout patch and a deleted
  connection cable patch; each is a strict no-op.
- Verification: focused recommendations 64/64; `npm test` 255/255; `npm run
  lint`; `npm run build` (known non-fatal large-chunk warning only); local
  frontend `/` and backend `/api/projects/default` HTTP checks both 200. No new
  browser or visual QA was performed for this domain-only change.
- Commit: `d36aecf fix: ignore missing improvement targets` (pushed).

### Repeated improvement-patch guard (2026-07-14)

- Made existing-target layout and cable patches idempotent as well. If the
  suggested position/rotation or cable length is already present,
  `applyImprovement()` returns the exact project instead of allocating an
  indistinguishable new state.
- This closes the repeat-action boundary across layout, cable length, and
  automatic connections, avoiding unnecessary downstream state work while
  preserving immutable updates for real changes.
- Test-first regression verifies repeated layout and cable patches are strict
  no-ops.
- Verification: focused recommendations 65/65; `npm test` 256/256; `npm run
  lint`; `npm run build` (known non-fatal large-chunk warning only); local
  frontend `/` and backend `/api/projects/default` HTTP checks both 200. No new
  browser or visual QA was performed for this domain-only change.
- Commit: `4008b33 fix: make improvement patches idempotent` (pushed).

### Case-insensitive WAN port recognition (2026-07-14)

- Fixed custom/imported switch ports whose ID used uppercase `WAN` while their
  display name did not contain WAN. The shared predicate previously compared
  only the ID's exact lowercase spelling, so such a port could be offered for
  automatic switch uplink and counted as downstream network capacity.
- WAN port IDs now compare case-insensitively, matching the existing port-name
  behavior and the router LAN ID handling. Test-first coverage confirms an
  uppercase `WAN` ID named `Internet` cannot receive an automatic uplink.
- Verification: focused regression failed before the fix and passed afterward;
  `npm test` 257/257; `npm run lint`; `npm run build` (known non-fatal
  large-chunk warning only); local frontend `/` and backend
  `/api/projects/default` HTTP checks both 200. No browser or visual QA was
  performed for this domain-only change.
- Commit: `3515306 fix: match WAN port ids case-insensitively` (pushed).

### Invalid connection-length analysis guard (2026-07-14)

- Aligned live wiring analysis with the persisted project contract for cable
  lengths. Connections with a missing, non-finite, zero, or negative length are
  now reported as `invalid_connection_length`, exposed for invalid-connection
  cleanup, and skipped before physical ports are occupied.
- The shared power graph now excludes the same malformed connections, preventing
  them from creating false powered paths, load totals, overload warnings, or
  purchase suggestions. Recommendation test fixtures that represented valid
  topology were updated with explicit positive lengths.
- Test-first regressions failed against both prior behaviors: analysis did not
  report the invalid connection, and a zero-length power link contributed a
  false 300W load. Both passed after the guards were added.
- Verification: focused analysis regressions passed; `npm test` 259/259;
  `npm run lint`; `npm run build` (known non-fatal large-chunk warning only);
  local frontend `/` and backend `/api/projects/default` HTTP checks both 200.
  No browser or visual QA was performed for this domain-only change.
- Commit: `dc0a188 fix: reject invalid connection lengths in analysis` (pushed).

### Blank connection-ID analysis guard (2026-07-15)

- Aligned live wiring analysis with the persisted project contract for
  connection IDs. Missing, empty, and whitespace-only IDs are now reported as
  `invalid_connection_id`, retain their raw value for cleanup filtering, and
  are skipped before endpoint occupancy or topology analysis.
- The shared power graph applies the same non-blank ID requirement, preventing
  malformed power links from creating false powered paths, load totals,
  overload warnings, or purchase suggestions.
- Test-first regressions failed against both prior behaviors: analysis omitted
  the invalid-ID error and treated the target as powered, while the shared graph
  counted a 300W load across a whitespace-ID connection. Both passed after the
  guards were added.
- Verification: focused analysis regressions passed; `npm test` 261/261;
  `npm run lint`; `npm run build` (known non-fatal large-chunk warning only);
  local frontend `/` and backend `/api/projects/default` HTTP checks both 200.
  No browser or visual QA was performed for this domain-only change.
- Commit: `546722d fix: reject blank connection ids in analysis` (pushed).

### Blank connection-name analysis guard (2026-07-15)

- Aligned live wiring analysis with the persisted project contract for
  connection names. Missing, empty, and whitespace-only names are now reported
  as `invalid_connection_name` and skipped before endpoint occupancy or
  topology analysis, so an unsavable link cannot hide an unpowered port.
- The shared power graph applies the same non-blank name requirement, preventing
  malformed power links from creating false powered paths, load totals,
  overload warnings, or purchase suggestions.
- Test-first regressions failed against both prior behaviors: analysis omitted
  the invalid-name error and treated the target as powered, while the shared
  graph counted a 300W load across a whitespace-name connection. Both passed
  after the guards were added. Existing recommendation fixtures that model
  valid topology now carry explicit non-blank connection names.
- Verification: focused analysis regressions passed; `npm test` 263/263;
  `npm run lint`; `npm run build` (known non-fatal large-chunk warning only);
  local frontend `/` and backend `/api/projects/default` HTTP checks both 200;
  `git diff --check` passed. No browser or visual QA was performed for this
  domain-only change.
- Commit: `617e6b0 fix: reject blank connection names in analysis` (pushed).

### Unknown connection cable-type analysis guard (2026-07-15)

- Aligned live wiring analysis with the persisted cable-type enum. A legacy
  center-to-center connection with a missing or unknown `cableType` previously
  received only the informational `legacy_connection` issue even though project
  loading and the backend reject it.
- Unsupported values now produce the cleanup-eligible
  `invalid_connection_cable_type` error before legacy or port-level analysis.
  Valid legacy connections remain informational, while valid cable types that
  mismatch bound ports retain the existing `cable_type_mismatch` behavior.
- The public-interface regression was confirmed RED because analysis omitted the
  invalid-type error, then GREEN after reusing the shared `CABLE_TYPE_VALUES`
  contract in analysis.
- Verification: focused regression passed; complete analysis tests 32/32;
  `npm test` 264/264; `npm run lint`; `npm run build` (known non-fatal
  large-chunk warning only); local frontend `/` and backend
  `/api/projects/default` HTTP checks both 200; `git diff --check` passed. No
  browser or visual QA was performed for this domain-only change.
- Commit: `64cd92f fix: reject unknown cable types in analysis` (pushed).

### Unsupported port-direction analysis guard (2026-07-15)

- Aligned live wiring analysis with the persisted port-direction enum. An
  unused non-power port whose direction was outside `input`, `output`, and
  `bidirectional` previously produced no issue even though project loading and
  the backend reject the object.
- Every port is now checked independently of connection occupancy. Unsupported
  directions produce the object-level `invalid_port_direction_definition`
  error, so malformed imported/live data has a visible device-scoped diagnosis.
  Existing valid-enum directions that contradict AC/DC port types retain the
  more specific `invalid_power_port_definition` behavior.
- The public-interface regression was confirmed RED with an unused HDMI port
  using `sideways`, then GREEN after the enum guard was added.
- Verification: focused regression passed; complete analysis tests 33/33;
  `npm test` 265/265; `npm run lint`; `npm run build` (known non-fatal
  large-chunk warning only); local frontend `/` and backend
  `/api/projects/default` HTTP checks both 200; `git diff --check` passed. No
  browser or visual QA was performed for this domain-only change.
- Commit: `390cd15 fix: report unsupported port directions` (pushed).

### Duplicate port-ID ambiguity guard (2026-07-15)

- Aligned live wiring analysis with the persisted per-device port-ID uniqueness
  contract. Duplicate IDs previously produced no object-level issue, and port
  lookup silently selected the first match when a connection referenced the
  ambiguous ID.
- Analysis now indexes duplicate port IDs once per device and reports one
  `duplicate_port_id_definition` error per duplicated value, including when the
  ports are unused. Connections that reference an ambiguous endpoint produce
  the cleanup-eligible `ambiguous_connection_port` error and stop before port
  occupancy or topology analysis.
- The shared power graph applies the same ambiguity guard, preventing malformed
  devices from creating false powered paths, load totals, overload warnings, or
  downstream purchase suggestions.
- Three public-interface TDD cycles were confirmed RED then GREEN: unused
  duplicates lacked a device error; an ambiguous connection hid an unpowered
  target; and the standalone power graph counted a false 300W load.
- Verification: focused regressions passed; complete analysis tests 36/36;
  `npm test` 268/268; `npm run lint`; `npm run build` (known non-fatal
  large-chunk warning only); local frontend `/` and backend
  `/api/projects/default` HTTP checks both 200; `git diff --check` passed. No
  browser or visual QA was performed for this domain-only change.
- Commit: `0eeb79c fix: reject duplicate port id ambiguity` (pushed).

### Duplicate object-ID ambiguity guard (2026-07-15)

- Aligned live wiring analysis with the persisted project-wide object-ID
  uniqueness contract. Duplicate device IDs previously produced no analysis
  issue, and `Map` construction silently selected the last matching object when
  resolving connection endpoints.
- Analysis now reports one `duplicate_object_id_definition` error per duplicated
  value, including when the devices are unused. Connections that reference an
  ambiguous device produce the cleanup-eligible `ambiguous_connection_object`
  error and stop before self-reference, port occupancy, or topology analysis.
- The shared power graph applies the same ambiguity guard, preventing array
  ordering from creating false powered paths, load totals, overload warnings,
  or downstream purchase suggestions.
- Three public-interface TDD cycles were confirmed RED then GREEN: unused
  duplicates lacked an object error; an ambiguous connection hid an unpowered
  target; and the standalone power graph counted a false 300W load. The GREEN
  refactor then consolidated object and port duplicate scans into the shared
  internal `getDuplicateIds` helper.
- Verification: focused regressions passed; complete analysis tests 39/39;
  `npm test` 271/271; `npm run lint`; `npm run build` (known non-fatal
  large-chunk warning only); local frontend `/` and backend
  `/api/projects/default` HTTP checks both 200; `git diff --check` passed. No
  browser or visual QA was performed for this domain-only change.
- Commit: `a1b93f9 fix: reject duplicate object id ambiguity` (pushed).

### Blank object and endpoint-ID analysis guard (2026-07-15)

- Aligned live wiring analysis with the persisted non-blank object-ID contract.
  A device whose ID was missing, empty, or whitespace-only previously produced
  no object-level analysis issue.
- Invalid device IDs now produce `invalid_object_id_definition`, including when
  the device is unused. Connections whose `fromObjectId` or `toObjectId` is not
  a non-blank string produce the cleanup-eligible
  `invalid_connection_object_id` error before object lookup, port occupancy, or
  topology analysis.
- The shared power graph applies the same endpoint-ID guard, preventing invalid
  object keys from creating false powered paths, load totals, overload warnings,
  or downstream purchase suggestions.
- Three public-interface TDD cycles were confirmed RED then GREEN: an unused
  whitespace-ID device lacked an error; a connection to that device hid an
  unpowered target; and the standalone power graph counted a false 300W load.
- Verification: focused regressions passed; complete analysis tests 42/42;
  `npm test` 274/274; `npm run lint`; `npm run build` (known non-fatal
  large-chunk warning only); local frontend `/` and backend
  `/api/projects/default` HTTP checks both 200; `git diff --check` passed. No
  browser or visual QA was performed for this domain-only change.
- Commit: `398eb00 fix: reject blank object ids in analysis` (pushed).

### Blank port and endpoint-ID analysis guard (2026-07-15)

- Aligned live wiring analysis with the persisted non-blank port-ID contract.
  A device port whose ID was missing, empty, or whitespace-only previously
  produced no object-level issue when the port was unused.
- Invalid device port IDs now produce `invalid_port_id_definition`.
  Port-bound connections whose `fromPortId` or `toPortId` is not a non-blank
  string produce the cleanup-eligible `invalid_connection_port_id` error
  before endpoint lookup, occupancy, or topology analysis. Explicit blank IDs
  are no longer mislabeled as missing referenced ports.
- The shared power graph applies the same endpoint-ID guard, preventing an
  invalid port key that happens to exist in transient data from creating false
  powered paths, load totals, overload warnings, or downstream purchase
  suggestions.
- Three public-interface TDD cycles were confirmed RED then GREEN: an unused
  whitespace-ID port lacked an object error; a connection through that port hid
  an unpowered target; and the standalone power graph counted a false 300W load.
- Verification: focused regressions passed; complete analysis tests 45/45;
  `npm test` 277/277; `npm run lint`; `npm run build` (known non-fatal
  large-chunk warning only); local frontend `/` and backend
  `/api/projects/default` HTTP checks both 200; `git diff --check` passed. No
  browser or visual QA was performed for this domain-only change.
- Commit: `a82119c fix: reject blank port ids in analysis` (pushed).

### Blank port-type analysis guard (2026-07-15)

- Aligned live wiring analysis with the persisted non-blank port-type contract.
  An unused port whose `type` was missing, empty, or whitespace-only previously
  produced no device-level issue.
- Invalid port types now produce `invalid_port_type_definition`. A port-bound
  connection whose resolved endpoint has a blank type produces the
  cleanup-eligible `invalid_connection_port_type` error before compatibility,
  cable inference, occupancy, or topology analysis.
- This closes a concrete semantic bypass: two whitespace-only types were
  previously considered equal by the compatibility helper and could form an
  apparently valid `other` connection. Non-blank custom and future port types
  remain supported through the existing `other` cable behavior.
- Two public-interface TDD cycles were confirmed RED then GREEN: an unused
  whitespace-type port lacked an object error, and a connection between two
  whitespace-type ports was absent from the invalid-connection cleanup set.
- Verification: focused regressions passed; complete analysis tests 47/47;
  `npm test` 279/279; `npm run lint`; `npm run build` (known non-fatal
  large-chunk warning only); local frontend `/` and backend
  `/api/projects/default` HTTP checks both 200; `git diff --check` passed. No
  browser or visual QA was performed for this domain-only change.
- Commit: `9504542 fix: reject blank port types in analysis` (pushed).

### Blank port-name analysis guard (2026-07-15)

- Aligned live wiring analysis with the persisted non-blank port-name contract.
  An unused port whose display name was missing, empty, or whitespace-only
  previously produced no issue, leaving an unsavable device with a blank label
  in connection controls and diagnostics.
- Invalid names now produce the device-level `invalid_port_name_definition`
  error and identify the affected port by its stable ID. Existing connections
  are not marked for deletion because a display-name defect does not invalidate
  their endpoint IDs, directions, types, occupancy, or topology.
- The public-interface regression was confirmed RED because the blank-name port
  had no error, then GREEN after adding the focused definition guard.
- Verification: focused regression passed; complete analysis tests 48/48;
  `npm test` 280/280; `npm run lint`; `npm run build` (known non-fatal
  large-chunk warning only); local frontend `/` and backend
  `/api/projects/default` HTTP checks both 200; `git diff --check` passed. No
  browser or visual QA was performed for this domain-only change.
- Commit: `400fc34 fix: report blank port names in analysis` (pushed).

### Malformed live port-data guard (2026-07-15)

- Fixed a recommendation-panel crash caused by transient devices whose `ports`
  value was a non-array collection or whose port array contained `null`.
  `buildRecommendations()` previously failed while analysis scanned duplicate
  port IDs, and the recommendation builders had independent unsafe port loops.
- Added the shared `getPortRecords()` seam. Wiring analysis, the power graph,
  recommendation generation, and stale-patch validation now treat non-array
  collections as empty and ignore non-object port entries. Analysis still
  reports array entries without a usable port record through the existing
  `invalid_port_id_definition` diagnostic.
- One public-interface TDD cycle was confirmed RED then GREEN:
  `buildRecommendations()` threw `TypeError: items is not iterable` for a
  project containing both `ports: {}` and `ports: [null]`, then returned a
  stable empty result without inventing recommendations.
- Verification: focused regression passed; `npm test` 281/281; `npm run lint`;
  `npm run build` (known non-fatal large-chunk warning only); local frontend
  `/` and backend `/api/projects/default` HTTP checks both 200;
  `git diff --check` passed. No browser or visual QA was performed.
- Commit: `5672c1b fix: tolerate malformed live port data` (pushed).

### Malformed port endpoint-lookup guard (2026-07-15)

- Closed the remaining malformed-port crash after the shared collection guard.
  Wiring analysis and recommendations already filtered non-object port entries,
  but cable endpoint positioning still called `object.ports.find()` directly.
  A valid connection whose endpoint arrays began with `null` therefore threw
  while calculating cable length.
- `getPortWorldPosition()` now resolves endpoint ports through the existing
  `getPortRecords()` seam. Malformed entries retain their device-level
  `invalid_port_id_definition` diagnostics, while a valid later port remains
  connected, is not marked for cleanup, and still occupies its power input.
- One public-interface TDD cycle was confirmed RED then GREEN:
  `analyzeProjectWiring()` first threw while reading `candidate.id`, then
  successfully analyzed the same connection after the endpoint lookup change.
- Verification: focused regression passed; `npm test` 282/282; `npm run lint`;
  `npm run build` (known non-fatal large-chunk warning only); local frontend
  `/` and backend `/api/projects/default` HTTP checks both 200;
  `git diff --check` passed. No browser or visual QA was performed.
- Commit: `57bbb0e fix: ignore malformed ports in endpoint lookup` (pushed).

### Malformed live object/connection collection guard (2026-07-15)

- Problem: the public live-insight APIs assumed every `objects` and
  `connections` array entry was record-shaped. A transient `null` entry
  crashed wiring analysis while primitives and arrays could create ghost
  diagnostics or recommendations from `id === undefined`.
- Test-first regression: one App-shaped public behavior test mixes `null`,
  `undefined`, primitives, and array records with a valid floating object.
  It first failed with `TypeError` at `analyzeProjectWiring()`, then verified
  every exported analysis/recommendation entry point ignores non-record items
  without hiding the valid `drop_to_support` suggestion.
- Fix: added the dependency-free `getRecordItems()` collection seam and used
  it at the wiring analysis, power graph, layout analysis, free-improvement,
  purchase-suggestion, and recommendation-facade boundaries. Plain mid-edit
  records still flow into the existing field-level diagnostics.
- Verification: focused regression RED 0/1 then GREEN 1/1; `npm test`
  283/283; `npm run lint`; `npm run build` (known non-fatal large-chunk
  warning only); local frontend `/` and backend `/api/projects/default`
  HTTP checks both 200; `git diff --check` passed. No browser or visual QA
  was performed.
- Commit: `a81852b fix: ignore non-record live insight entries` (pushed).

### Invalid port-anchor live-analysis guard (2026-07-15)

- Problem: frontend/backend persistence validation and both formal schemas
  require every explicit port anchor to contain finite x/y/z values within
  `[-0.5, 0.5]`, but live wiring analysis silently accepted malformed or
  out-of-range anchors. Endpoint geometry then fell back to the device center,
  which could hide unsavable port data and produce misleading cable lengths.
- Test-first regression: an unused HDMI output with `anchor.x = 0.75` must
  produce one device-level `invalid_port_anchor_definition` error without
  marking any connection for cleanup. The focused public test first returned
  no diagnostic (RED 0/1), then passed GREEN 1/1.
- Fix: `project-validation.js` now exports the complete
  `isValidPortAnchor()` contract, including the valid missing/null cases.
  Wiring analysis reuses that seam for its explicit diagnostic rather than
  duplicating coordinate/range rules; existing topology and unpowered-input
  behavior remain unchanged.
- Verification: `npm test` 284/284; `npm run lint`; `npm run build` (known
  non-fatal large-chunk warning only); local frontend `/` and backend
  `/api/projects/default` HTTP checks both 200; `git diff --check` passed.
  No browser or visual QA was performed.
- Commit: `13a23b0 fix: report invalid port anchors` (pushed).

### Non-array live port-collection diagnostic (2026-07-15)

- Problem: the persisted project contract allows `ports` to be missing, `null`,
  or an array, but live wiring analysis silently converted record, string, and
  number values to an empty collection. That hid both the unsavable definition
  and every real wiring need carried by the affected device.
- Test-first regression: one public `analyzeProjectWiring()` behavior test uses
  three unused devices with `{}`, string, and number port collections. It first
  returned no matching issues (RED 0/1), then produced one stable object-level
  `invalid_port_collection_definition` error for each device (GREEN 1/1).
- Fix: the object-definition scan now reports every explicit non-null,
  non-array port collection. Downstream readers still treat the malformed
  collection as empty so analysis cannot crash or invent ports; missing and
  `null` values retain their existing valid contract behavior, and no
  connection is marked for cleanup.
- Verification: `npm test` 285/285; `npm run lint`; `npm run build` (known
  non-fatal large-chunk warning only); local frontend `/` and backend
  `/api/projects/default` HTTP checks both 200; `git diff --check` passed.
  No browser or visual QA was performed.
- Commit: `12139cb fix: report non-array port collections` (pushed).

### Non-string live port-name recommendation guard (2026-07-15)

- Problem: wiring analysis already reported a non-string port `name` through
  `invalid_port_name_definition`, but recommendation generation still called
  `.toLowerCase()` on that value while classifying switch WAN ports. A numeric
  live name therefore crashed the App-shaped `buildRecommendations()` flow
  instead of leaving the existing diagnostic visible.
- Test-first regression: one public behavior test uses a valid router LAN port
  and a switch Ethernet port whose `name` is `42`. It first failed at
  `isWanPort()` with `TypeError` (RED 0/1), then retained the wiring definition
  error and returned the valid `auto_uplink_switch` recommendation (GREEN 1/1).
- Fix: the existing shared `isWanPort()` seam now inspects the display name
  only when it is a string. Its three callers inherit the guard without new
  branches or a wider interface; ID-based, case-insensitive WAN recognition is
  unchanged.
- Verification: `npm test` 286/286; `npm run lint`; `npm run build` (known
  non-fatal large-chunk warning only); local frontend `/` and backend
  `/api/projects/default` HTTP checks both 200; `git diff --check` passed.
  No browser or visual QA was performed.
- Commit: `0942a21 fix: tolerate non-string port names` (pushed).

### Invalid maxLoad safety-fallback guard (2026-07-16)

- Problem: a catalog UPS with a 1000W safety limit and a valid 1200W downstream
  load correctly reported `power_overload` and `buy_ups_overload` when its live
  `maxLoad` was missing or null, but invalid `-1`, `NaN`, blank-string, and
  nonnumeric-string overrides were coerced to zero and suppressed both safety
  results instead of falling back to the catalog limit.
- One App-shaped table-driven public behavior test covers missing, null,
  explicit zero, negative, `NaN`, blank string, numeric string, and nonnumeric
  string overrides through `analyzeProjectWiring()` plus
  `buildRecommendations()`. It was reconfirmed RED 0/1 on the resumed clean
  base with exactly the four invalid cases false/false, then GREEN 1/1.
- Added the single-argument `getEffectiveMaxLoad(object)` seam in `analysis.js`.
  It owns catalog lookup, safe finite non-negative number/string parsing, and
  override precedence. Explicit `0` and nonblank numeric strings remain valid;
  unusable live values fall back to the catalog value and then zero.
- Wiring analysis, purchase recommendations, PropertiesEditor, and the
  SceneObjects power overlay now use the same effective-limit seam. The separate
  wattage behavior was deliberately left unchanged.
- Verification: focused RED 0/1 then GREEN 1/1; `npm test` 287/287;
  `npm run lint`; `npm run build` (known non-fatal large-chunk warning only);
  local frontend `/` and backend `/api/projects/default` HTTP checks both 200;
  `git diff --check` passed. No browser or visual QA was performed.
- Commit: `c35262e fix: fall back from invalid max load overrides` (pushed).
  The saved RED stash was consumed and dropped after the commit was protected
  on `origin/master`.

### Invalid wattage safety-fallback guard (2026-07-16)

- Problem: a catalog desktop PC with a 350W default connected to a valid 300W
  UPS correctly triggered `power_overload` and `buy_ups_overload` when its live
  `wattage` was missing or null, but invalid `-1`, `NaN`, blank-string, and
  nonnumeric-string overrides were coerced to zero and hid both safety results.
- One App-shaped table-driven public behavior test covers missing, null,
  explicit zero, negative, `NaN`, blank string, numeric string, and nonnumeric
  string overrides through `analyzeProjectWiring()` plus
  `buildRecommendations()`. It failed RED 0/1 with exactly the four unusable
  overrides false/false, then passed GREEN 1/1.
- Added the single-argument `getEffectiveWattage(object)` seam. It shares the
  private safe parser and catalog-fallback implementation with
  `getEffectiveMaxLoad(object)`, preserving explicit zero and numeric strings
  while falling back only for unusable live values.
- Recursive power-load calculation and PropertiesEditor now use the shared
  wattage seam. Wiring analysis, purchase recommendations, and the scene power
  overlay inherit the same result through `computeDevicePowerLoad()`; unknown
  devices without a catalog wattage retain the existing zero fallback.
- Verification: focused RED 0/1 then GREEN 1/1; `npm test` 288/288;
  `npm run lint`; `npm run build` (known non-fatal large-chunk warning only);

  `git diff --check` passed. No browser or visual QA was performed.

### Opaque-ID recommendation resolution (2026-07-16)

- Problem: the persisted project contract accepts any nonblank string for
  object and port IDs, including `:`, but recommendation generation parsed the
  display-oriented `unpowered:<object>:<port>` issue ID with `split(':')` and
  `endsWith()`. A contract-valid project with colon-bearing IDs therefore kept
  both `unpowered_input` issues while silently losing its valid free power fix
  and no-source purchase suggestion.
- One App-shaped public behavior test first proves the fixture passes
  `isProjectEnvelope()`, then reuses `analyzeProjectWiring()` output through
  `buildRecommendations()`. It failed RED 0/1 with `free=[]`, `purchases=[]`,
  and `total=0`, then passed GREEN 1/1 with `auto_power_device` plus
  `buy_power_for_unpowered` and the exact colon-bearing target port ID.
- Added the private `resolveUnpoweredInput()` seam in `recommendations.js`.
  Both free and purchase builders now use structured `issue.objectIds` to
  locate the device and an exact full-issue-ID match to resolve its port;
  neither consumer splits or suffix-guesses opaque IDs.
- Verification: focused RED 0/1 then GREEN 1/1; complete recommendations tests
  72/72; `npm test` 289/289; `npm run lint`; `npm run build` (known non-fatal
  large-chunk warning only); local frontend `/` and backend
  `/api/projects/default` HTTP checks both 200; `git diff --check` passed. No
  browser or visual QA was performed.
- Commit: `b92d185 fix: preserve opaque IDs in recommendations` (pushed).

### Non-string live model-ID recommendation guard (2026-07-16)

- Problem: the App recomputes `buildRecommendations()` on every relevant
  render, but display discovery called `.startsWith()` through optional chaining
  on each candidate `modelId`. Optional chaining protects only nullish values;
  a record-shaped live object with numeric `modelId` therefore threw a
  `TypeError` before its valid `type: 'monitor'` fallback could be used.
- One App-shaped public behavior test passes precomputed wiring issues into the
  recommendation facade for an HDMI source and a typed monitor whose live
  `modelId` is `42`. It failed RED 0/1 with
  `candidate.modelId?.startsWith is not a function`, then passed GREEN 1/1 and
  returned the valid `auto_connect_display` HDMI suggestion.
- Display matching now narrows the live model ID to a string before testing the
  existing `monitor` and `ultrawide` prefixes. Valid string model IDs and the
  independent `candidate.type === 'monitor'` fallback retain their behavior;
  no interface or unrelated recommendation path changed.
- Verification: focused RED 0/1 then GREEN 1/1; complete recommendations tests
  73/73; `npm test` 290/290; `npm run lint`; `npm run build` (known non-fatal
  large-chunk warning only); local frontend `/` and backend
  `/api/projects/default` HTTP checks both 200; `git diff --check` passed. No
  browser or visual QA was performed.
- Commit: `840ebba fix: tolerate non-string model ids` (pushed).

### Invalid port-ID recommendation guard (2026-07-16)

- Problem: live wiring analysis correctly reported a numeric port ID through
  `invalid_port_id_definition`, but recommendation action and capacity scans
  still treated that port as addressable. With one router LAN port, the invalid
  endpoint received an `auto_network_device` patch carrying `toPortId: 42`,
  the valid endpoint lost its free fix, and the same invalid demand created a
  false `buy_switch` suggestion.
- One App-shaped public behavior test keeps the analysis diagnostic visible and
  places the invalid endpoint before a valid one. It failed RED 0/1 with the
  invalid automatic patch, `buy_switch`, and total 2, then passed GREEN 1/1
  with only the valid endpoint's automatic network patch and total 1.
- Added the private `getActionablePortRecords()` seam in
  `recommendations.js`. Automatic power, network, display, and relevant
  capacity scans now use only record ports whose IDs are nonblank strings.
  Pure power-input classification deliberately keeps the broader record view,
  so a device declaring a malformed input cannot become an independent power
  root.
- Verification: focused RED 0/1 then GREEN 1/1; complete recommendations tests
  74/74; `npm test` 291/291; `npm run lint`; `npm run build` (known non-fatal
  large-chunk warning only); local frontend `/` and backend
  `/api/projects/default` HTTP checks both 200; `git diff --check` passed. No
  browser or visual QA was performed.
- Commit: `1b63d53 fix: ignore invalid port ids in recommendations` (pushed).

### Invalid object-ID recommendation guard (2026-07-16)

- Problem: live wiring analysis correctly reported a numeric object ID through
  `invalid_object_id_definition`, but recommendation builders still treated the
  device as addressable. It received an `auto_network_device` patch carrying
  `toObjectId: 42`, consumed the only router LAN port, hid the valid endpoint's
  free fix, and created a false `buy_switch` suggestion. Applying that patch
  introduced a new `invalid_connection_object_id` error.
- One App-shaped public behavior test drives the complete facade → apply →
  reanalyze path. It failed RED 0/1 with the invalid patch, false purchase,
  total 2, and a newly introduced connection error, then passed GREEN 1/1 with
  only the valid endpoint patch, no purchase, total 1, and no new error.
- Added the private `getActionableObjectRecords()` seam. Both exported
  recommendation builders now keep two views: all record objects remain in
  wiring, power, length, layout, and support geometry calculations, while only
  objects whose IDs are nonblank strings can become patch targets, topology
  endpoints, or capacity/demand candidates. A focused harness confirmed an
  invalid-ID desk still supports a valid device without inventing a drop fix.
- Verification: focused RED 0/1 then GREEN 1/1; complete recommendations tests
  75/75; `npm test` 292/292; `npm run lint`; `npm run build` (known non-fatal
  large-chunk warning only); local frontend `/` and backend
  `/api/projects/default` HTTP checks both 200; `git diff --check` passed. No
  browser or visual QA was performed.
- Commit: `9e17130 fix: ignore invalid object ids in recommendations` (pushed).

### Duplicate object-ID recommendation ambiguity guard (2026-07-16)

- Problem: wiring analysis correctly reported duplicate nonblank object IDs,
  but recommendation builders still treated every matching device as
  addressable. With one router LAN port, the first duplicate endpoint stole the
  valid endpoint's automatic network fix and created a false `buy_switch`.
  Applying the generated patch was a no-op because object lookup resolved the
  same ID to the other duplicate, whose port differed.
- One App-shaped public behavior test drives the facade → apply → reanalyze
  path. It failed RED 0/1 with the duplicate-target patch, false purchase,
  total 2, and zero applied connections, then passed GREEN 1/1 with only the
  valid endpoint patch, no purchase, total 1, and one valid applied connection.
- Deepened the private `getActionableObjectRecords()` seam to count exact
  nonblank string IDs and admit only objects whose ID occurs once. Both public
  recommendation builders inherit the guard for patch targets, topology, and
  capacity/demand scans, while the complete record view remains available to
  wiring, power, layout, cable-length, and support-geometry analysis.
- Verification: focused RED 0/1 then GREEN 1/1; complete recommendations tests
  76/76; `npm test` 293/293; `npm run lint`; `npm run build` (known non-fatal
  large-chunk warning only); local frontend `/` and backend
  `/api/projects/default` HTTP checks both 200; `git diff --check` passed. No
  browser or visual QA was performed.
- Commit: `e9f6bd3 fix: ignore duplicate object ids in recommendations`
  (pushed).

### Duplicate port-ID recommendation ambiguity guard (2026-07-16)

- Problem: wiring analysis correctly reported duplicate nonblank port IDs, but
  recommendation builders still treated those ports as actionable. With one
  router LAN port, an endpoint containing two `eth-dup` inputs stole the valid
  endpoint's automatic network fix and created a false `buy_switch`. Applying
  the generated patch added a connection that analysis immediately rejected as
  `ambiguous_connection_port`.
- One App-shaped public behavior test drives the facade → apply → reanalyze
  path. It failed RED 0/1 with the ambiguous-port patch, false purchase, total
  2, and a newly introduced connection error, then passed GREEN 1/1 with only
  the valid endpoint patch, no purchase, total 1, and no new error.
- Deepened the private `getActionablePortRecords()` seam to count exact
  nonblank string IDs within each object and admit only ports whose ID occurs
  once. Both public recommendation builders inherit the guard for automatic
  actions and capacity/demand scans. Power-role classification, wiring
  diagnostics, the power graph, and physical endpoint calculations retain the
  complete port-record view.
- Verification: focused RED 0/1 then GREEN 1/1; complete recommendations tests
  77/77; `npm test` 294/294; `npm run lint`; `npm run build` (known non-fatal
  large-chunk warning only); local frontend `/` and backend
  `/api/projects/default` HTTP checks both 200; `git diff --check` passed. No
  browser or visual QA was performed.
- Commit: `7f2c288 fix: ignore duplicate port ids in recommendations` (pushed).

### Stale ambiguous-port connection guard (2026-07-16)

- Problem: a valid automatic network suggestion could become stale after an
  endpoint was edited to contain two ports with the suggested ID. Applying the
  old patch still appended the connection, and wiring analysis then reported a
  newly introduced `ambiguous_connection_port` error alongside the existing
  duplicate-port diagnostic.
- One public behavior test generates a real `auto_network_device` suggestion,
  duplicates the target port before application, applies the stale suggestion,
  and reanalyzes the result. It failed RED 0/1 because a connection was added
  and the ambiguity error appeared, then passed GREEN 1/1 with an identity
  no-op, no connection, and no newly introduced connection error.
- `applyImprovement()` now resolves both new-connection endpoints through the
  existing `getActionablePortRecords()` seam. Application therefore revalidates
  the current project and rejects endpoint port IDs that are blank, invalid, or
  no longer unique, while normal unique endpoints keep their existing behavior.
- Verification: focused RED 0/1 then GREEN 1/1; complete recommendations tests
  78/78; `npm test` 295/295; `npm run lint`; `npm run build` (known non-fatal
  large-chunk warning only); local frontend `/` and backend
  `/api/projects/default` HTTP checks both 200; `git diff --check` passed. No
  browser or visual QA was performed.
- Commit: `8a82217 fix: reject stale ambiguous port patches` (pushed).

### Stale ambiguous-object layout guard (2026-07-16)

- Problem: a valid `move_inside_room` suggestion could become stale after a
  second object was edited to share the suggested target's ID. Application
  found the first match but then updated every object with that ID, moving both
  objects to the same position and returning a new project despite the existing
  `duplicate_object_id_definition` error.
- One public behavior test generates a real move suggestion, adds the duplicate
  object before application, and observes the project through
  `applyImprovement()` plus wiring analysis. It failed RED 0/1 because both
  objects moved to `x=2` and the operation was not an identity no-op, then
  passed GREEN 1/1 with both original positions and the duplicate-ID diagnostic
  preserved.
- The layout-patch branch now resolves its current target through the existing
  `getActionableObjectRecords()` seam. Missing, invalid, or non-unique target
  IDs therefore return the exact current project, while unique valid layout
  patches keep their immutable update behavior. Cable and connection patches
  were deliberately left unchanged.
- Verification: focused RED 0/1 then GREEN 1/1; adjacent layout tests 2/2;
  complete recommendations tests 79/79; `npm test` 296/296; `npm run lint`;
  `npm run build` (known non-fatal large-chunk warning only); local frontend
  `/` and backend `/api/projects/default` HTTP checks both 200;
  `git diff --check` passed. No browser or visual QA was performed.
- Commit: `e7393a4 fix: reject stale ambiguous layout patches` (pushed).

### Stale ambiguous-object connection guard (2026-07-16)

- Problem: a valid automatic network suggestion could become stale after a
  second endpoint was edited to share the target object's ID. Because the
  application index used last-item-wins `Map` semantics, a compatible duplicate
  still allowed the old patch to append a connection that wiring analysis
  immediately rejected as `ambiguous_connection_object`.
- One public behavior test generates a real `auto_network_device` suggestion,
  adds a same-ID endpoint with the same compatible port, applies the stale
  suggestion, and reanalyzes the result. It failed RED 0/1 with one appended
  connection and a newly introduced ambiguity error, then passed GREEN 1/1 as
  a strict identity no-op with no connection or new error.
- The new-connection branch now builds its current endpoint index from the
  existing `getActionableObjectRecords()` seam. Either source or target must
  have a valid, unique current object ID before port compatibility, cable type,
  occupancy, and append checks can run. The existing actionable-port guard and
  all normal unique-endpoint behavior remain unchanged.
- Verification: focused RED 0/1 then GREEN 1/1; stale object/port endpoint tests
  2/2; all `applyImprovement` tests 12/12; complete recommendations tests 80/80;
  `npm test` 297/297; `npm run lint`; `npm run build` (known non-fatal
  large-chunk warning only); local frontend `/` and backend
  `/api/projects/default` HTTP checks both 200; `git diff --check` passed. No
  browser or visual QA was performed.
- Commit: `99dc1a6 fix: reject stale ambiguous object patches` (pushed).

### Stale ambiguous-connection cable guard (2026-07-16)

- Problem: a valid `extend_cable` suggestion could become stale after a second
  connection was edited to share the target connection's ID. Application found
  the first match but then updated every matching record, changing two lengths
  from `[1, 5]` to `[3.3, 3.3]` despite the existing
  `duplicate_connection_id` error.
- One public behavior test generates a real cable-extension suggestion, adds a
  same-ID connection with a different length, applies the stale suggestion, and
  reanalyzes the result. It failed RED 0/1 because both records changed and the
  operation returned a new project, then passed GREEN 1/1 as a strict identity
  no-op with both original lengths and the duplicate-ID diagnostic preserved.
- Added the private `getActionableConnectionRecords()` seam, symmetric with the
  existing object and port helpers. Cable-patch application now resolves only a
  record-shaped connection whose ID is a nonblank string and unique in the
  current project. Unrelated duplicate IDs do not block a unique target, and
  the raw connection array is never filtered or written back.
- Verification: focused RED 0/1 then GREEN 1/1; normal/ambiguous cable tests
  2/2; all `applyImprovement` tests 13/13; complete recommendations tests 81/81;
  `npm test` 298/298; `npm run lint`; `npm run build` (known non-fatal
  large-chunk warning only); local frontend `/` and backend
  `/api/projects/default` HTTP checks both 200; `git diff --check` passed. No
  browser or visual QA was performed.
- Commit: `a4f1ab7 fix: reject stale ambiguous cable patches` (pushed).

### External Chrome DOM runtime check (2026-07-14)

- Performed a real local runtime check with external Chrome headless against
  `http://127.0.0.1:5173/`; no Codex in-app browser, IAB, screenshot, or image
  output was used.
- After a 5-second virtual-time wait, the dumped DOM contained the `DeskLab`
  title, mounted `#root`, an active Three.js canvas (764×316), and the current
  default-project controls: `布局检查 (2)`, `布线检查 (5)`, and `改进建议 (6)`.
- This is DOM/runtime evidence only, not pixel-level visual QA; no screenshot
  was captured or claimed.
- Follow-up button-level interaction succeeded through the same external Chrome
  DevTools endpoint using Windows' built-in .NET WebSocket client. It opened
  `改进建议 (6)`, verified the dialog title `AI 优化与改进建议`, `免费改进 1`,
  `加购建议 5`, and the `一键修复所有免费项 (1)` button, then closed the dialog
  and verified it was gone. No repair, save, screenshot, or project-data write
  was performed; this is interaction-state QA, not pixel-level visual QA.
- A separate temporary-browser run then clicked `一键修复所有免费项 (1)` without
  saving: the live UI changed to `免费改进 0` and the apply-all button vanished.
  After the temporary browser closed, the local API still reported the original
  7 objects and 2 connections, confirming no persisted default-project data was
  changed. Local frontend and backend HTTP checks both remained 200.

Notes on the power-load slices (2026-06-25):
- `analysis.js` now exports `toPowerValue(value)` (coerce wattage/maxLoad to a safe
  non-negative number as defense in depth for malformed transient live state)
  and `classifyPowerLoad(currentLoad, maxLoad)`
  → `'overload' | 'warning' | 'ok'` (with `POWER_WARNING_RATIO = 0.9`).
- Both helpers are the single source of truth for overload/warning thresholds.
  Consumers: `analyzeProjectWiring`, `recommendations.js`, `SceneObjects.jsx`
  `PowerStatusOverlay`, and `PropertiesEditor.jsx` load badge. Do not re-inline
  `currentLoad > maxLoad * 0.9` style math in new UI — reuse `classifyPowerLoad`.
- `recommendations.js` nearest-device loops now use `calculatePositionDistance`
  (from `connections.js`) so a port-bearing object with no/NaN position no longer
  throws — it is simply skipped.

## Frontend Architecture

### Domain modules (`src/domain/`)

Core modules:
- `recommendations.js` — **free improvements + purchase suggestions engine** (see below)
- `analysis.js` — wiring analysis: port validation, power cycle detection, overload/warning, shared `buildPowerGraph()` for load aggregation
- `layout-analysis.js` — layout analysis: overlap, out-of-bounds, floating, outlet-off-wall
- `connections.js` — port compatibility, cable type inference, distance/length evaluation, ethernet topology
- `catalog.js` — device catalog (17 models across 5 categories), hydration, port anchors
- `geometry.js` — 3D bounds, overlap detection, footprint rotation
- `placement.js` — catalog object placement with room constraints
- `project-validation.js` — `isProjectEnvelope()` shared by draft.js and project-client.js
- `project-client.js` — versioned load/save/validate/recovery HTTP client
- `project-history.js` — undo/redo with grouping and camera awareness
- `project-access.js` — editability gates for canvas interactions
- `draft.js` / `draft-storage.js` — local draft persistence and recovery
- `identifiers.js` — collision-resistant entity IDs
- `status-notifier.js` — stale-timer-safe status messages
- `keyboard-controls.js` — keyboard shortcuts for object manipulation
- `camera-snapshot.js` / `coordinates.js` / `project-export.js`

Test files under `test/` mirror the domain modules.

### Recommendations Module (`recommendations.js`)

**Free improvements** (`buildFreeImprovements(room, objects, connections)`):
| Code | Rank | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| `move_inside_room` | 0 | Move out-of-bounds object inside room |
| `drop_to_support` | 1 | Drop floating object to support/floor |
| `snap_outlet_to_wall` | 2 | Snap wall outlet to nearest wall |
| `auto_power_device` | 3 | Connect unpowered device to nearest power source |
| `auto_uplink_switch` | 4 | Join an unconnected switch to an available router LAN port |
| `auto_network_device` | 5 | Connect an unnetworked device to a router-reachable switch/router |
| `auto_connect_display` | 6 | Connect HDMI/DP/USB-C output to nearest monitor |
| `extend_cable` | 7 | Extend cable to recommended length |

**Purchase suggestions** (`buildPurchaseSuggestions(objects, connections)`):
| Code | Trigger |
|------|---------|
| `buy_power_source` | Daisy-chained power strips → UPS |
| `buy_cable` | Short cable / low slack → longer cable |
| `buy_switch` | Unconnected ethernet devices exceed free router LAN plus router-reachable switch capacity |
| `buy_power_strip` | Power strip all AC outputs occupied |
| `buy_ups_overload` | Power hub external load > maxLoad |
| `buy_power_for_unpowered` | Unpowered device with no nearby free port → strip/UPS |

**Patch application**:
- `applyImprovement(project, suggestion)` — apply single patch (layout/cable/newConnection)
- `applyAllImprovements(project, suggestions)` — apply all sequentially
- `buildRecommendations(project, options?)` — facade returning `{ freeImprovements, purchases, total }`; accepts precomputed `wiringIssues` to avoid repeated analysis in UI render paths.

All suggestion types are round-trip tested: applying the suggested patch clears the corresponding analysis issue.

### Key architectural patterns:
- Nested `Map<string, Map<string, *>>` for port occupancy tracking (NOT string-key concatenation)
- `isProjectEnvelope()` shared by draft.js and project-client.js for validation parity
- UI delegates to domain logic; no duplicated math in components
- Cable types inferred via `inferCableType()`, not hardcoded

## Backend Architecture

Source:
```
D:\desklab\backend\src\store.js     — atomic file writes, backup/recovery, ETag versioning
D:\desklab\backend\src\validate.js  — request body validation and normalization
```

Tests: `D:\desklab\backend\test\server.test.js`, `D:\desklab\backend\test\validate.test.js`
Contracts: `D:\desklab\backend\contracts\project.schema.json`, `openapi.yaml`

### Key backend facts:
- `validateProjectBody` normalizes and strips unknown fields. Known optional fields: `category`, `modelId`, `assetUrl`, `color`, `wattage`, `maxLoad`, `ports`, `camera`, `connections`.
- `wattage` and `maxLoad` are validated as non-negative finite numbers when present (fixed in `e15b9de`).
- Port occupancy uses nested Maps (matching frontend pattern).
- 5MB request body limit. Optimistic concurrency with `If-Match` / `ETag`.
- Backup recovery via `/api/projects/default/recover-backup`.

## Remote Demo Deployment Policy

- The remote demo environment is not the primary development backend. Use the
  local backend at port `3001` during normal development.
- Do not deploy to, restart, or depend on a remote environment unless the user
  explicitly requests deployment or demo work.
- Host addresses, tunnel URLs, service names, and credential locations are kept
  out of this tracked memory bank so the public repository contains no private
  infrastructure access details.

## Verification Gates

Frontend:
```bash
cd D:\desklab\frontend
npm test          # 237 tests
npm run lint      # eslint .
npm run build     # vite build (known large chunk warning is OK)
```

Backend:
```bash
cd D:\desklab\backend
npm test              # 32 tests
npm run check:contracts  # schema + openapi checks
```

If rendered UI behavior changes, do browser QA against localhost if browser runtime works.

## High-Value Next Work

The autonomous hardening backlog and recommendation foundation are complete.
Generic model-asset and project-history hardening work is complete through the
currently audited cases and safe to continue in small slices.
Remaining work:

1. **Product-design-dependent** (confirm intent with product owner first):
   - Richer paid purchase recommendations (which products, when, quantities)
   - Deeper multi-step changes after purchase beyond the shipped safe
     add → selected hardware → connection-panel guidance
   - Browser/visual QA of the new fix buttons

2. **If continuing autonomously without product direction**:
   - Browser/visual QA for rendered UI behavior.
   - Small focused hardening found from current code evidence.

3. **Always start from current evidence**:
```bash
cd D:\desklab\frontend
git status --short
git log -5 --oneline

cd D:\desklab\backend
git status --short
git log -5 --oneline
```

## Communication Style

The user is the product owner. Keep updates brief: what was found, what was changed, files changed, verification run, commit SHA. Do not ask for "Proceed" on ordinary code work.

## Quick Start for Next Agent

1. Re-check git state and recent commits for both repos.
2. Check or start services as needed (frontend :5173, backend :3001).
3. Pick one high-value, reproducible issue.
4. Write a failing test first where practical.
5. Make the smallest fix.
6. Run full verification.
7. Commit only relevant files.
8. Update this memory bank only at handoff, quota low, or model switch.
